"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",27,And I couldn’t imagine he’s in a good position now.” Asked later in the interview whether she took Rolfe to be serious she said: “Mm yeah.

"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",29,"I think he really did – I think everything is said in like, said in jest is like, oh, it would be a paid holiday, but then when it really happens, is it really a fun paid holiday, like is it really not that serious?” Asked again whether the comments were made flippantly she said “I think some were considered and some were flippant."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",30,"’Cause you have to consider something to say something on several occasions.” She said she believed Rolfe had made similar comments on “maybe” five occasions, and that she had responded that it would not be a “fun holiday at all”."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",31,"In her later statement, she said this occurred when they were talking about going on a holiday and Rolfe would say it off the cuff."

"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",37,"“Despite me being such an apparently bad guy, [she] stayed with me until I broke off the relationship with her in 2018 and was devastated when I did so.” When asked by Pennuto during her interview why she had not “done anything” with the comments she said Rolfe made to her about a paid holiday, the former fiancee responded: “I don’t know … I loved him at the time and I just – I would say to him, ‘you don’t want to go on that kind of holiday, it’s not a holiday, it’s serious,’ and then he would just like kind of laugh it off."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",38,"“So I think I, in myself, tried to tell myself that it was – it wasn’t real, like he didn’t actually mean that sort of thing."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",39,"But there’s no other reason, like I can’t think of why I didn’t tell anyone.” Rolfe and the woman met in late 2017 and were engaged in March 2018, she told police."

"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",42,Pennuto and Newell asked the woman extensive questions about Rolfe’s conduct as a police officer.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",43,The woman also told police during her interview that Rolfe had said to her – she believed when he was teaching her to shoot at a range – that he would always be the first person to get his gun out if required on a job.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",44,"She said in her later signed statement that Rolfe had said to her at the home they shared “I always get my gun out first”, and that he had thought it was funny in the context he was saying it."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",45,"He also told her, she said, that he did not turn on his body-worn camera, because he did not want people at the station to see what he had been doing."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",46,"Rolfe’s camera was on during the shooting of Walker, and throughout his time in Yuendumu, with portions of the footage played during his trial."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",47,Rolfe’s former fiancee also told police that the “awful” and “terrible” culture at Alice Springs police station generally of “bitching” behind people’s backs was so bad that she ended up leaving the force.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",48,"In December last year, the prosecution in Rolfe’s murder case made an unsuccessful application to include material relating to his alleged history in policing, known as tendency evidence, in his trial."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",49,The prosecution sought to include evidence regarding four incidents in which they alleged Rolfe may have improperly used force while he was involved in an arrest.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",50,"But his lawyers argued in a pre-trial hearing that on all four occasions Rolfe had been cleared of using inappropriate force, and there had not been any finding of wrongdoing against him during his career."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",51,Justice Burns said during the hearing that the prosecution appeared to have “cherrypicked” four arrests from potentially hundreds of others in which Rolfe had been involved without incident.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",52,"Most of the former fiancee’s interview and statement was not referred to in this application, but her claims relating to the arrest of a man called Malcolm Ryder were referred to by the prosecution as something they would seek to rely on to establish what they alleged was a pattern of behaviour by Rolfe."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",53,She said in her interview that Rolfe told her he had asked a colleague at Alice Springs police station to scratch his face after he arrested Ryder in 2018.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",54,She said Rolfe wanted to make it appear that Ryder had scratched him during the arrest to justify his use of force.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",55,She and Rolfe were not dating at the time of the Ryder incident and she said in her statement that Rolfe told her this later.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",56,Ryder was cleared of charges of assaulting police.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",57,The fiancee’s claims did not form part of that trial.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",58,"Rolfe’s lawyer, Luke Officer, said in a statement to the Guardian that it was important to note that so little of the former fiancee’s interview was used in the prosecution’s application."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",59,He said the portions referred to in this article were not raised in the application and the transcript and allegations in it were not raised at trial.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",60,"“If you chose to publish certain extracts of the transcript that were not relied upon by the prosecution and rejected by the trial judge in a failed application to introduce tendency evidence then in our view that is not fair, accurate and balanced.” The transcript of the interview and other materials were released to the media just over two weeks ago after the Guardian and other outlets successfully argued for the lifting of about 20 suppression orders on the case."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",61,"The woman also gave a second interview to police, but the transcript of this interview was not included in the prosecution’s evidence."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",62,"During the court hearing determining whether the orders should be lifted, David Edwardson, QC for Rolfe, argued that the tendency evidence was “misconceived” and that suppression orders regarding it should therefore remain in place."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",63,"He said the tendency material was “no more than an argument that was advanced by the prosecution, unsuccessfully, as to conduct imputed against Mr Rolfe”."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",64,“It was inadmissible.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",65,It’s unsubstantiated.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",66,"And there is no public interest, in my submission, in it being put out into the ether, so to speak."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",67,“So that’s the basis upon which we maintain our objection.” But Justice Burns said the public interest in open justice and scrutiny of the court’s decisions outweighed any potential damage to Rolfe’s reputation.
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",68,"“Whichever way one looks at the matter, while there may be some embarrassment and potentially some damage to the reputation of Mr Rolfe if the material which is the subject of the suppression orders is published, that is of lesser importance … than ensuring that the public has the means of scrutinising the decisions which have been made by this court and of understanding the decisions that the court has made,” he said."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",69,"“In my view, it is in the public interest that the decisions made by the court surrounding the evidence which the Crown sought to lead at trial and which was rejected be subject to open scrutiny."
"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",70,"“This is particularly so in a case where there are post-trial claims made of interference in the charging process.” Michael Riches, the NT independent commissioner against corruption, announced on 29 March that he was investigating “allegations of improper conduct relating to the arrest and charge” of Rolfe in relation to Walker’s death."

Johnson’s political cowardice applies brake to cheap energy as he bets on nuclear,9,The target may even be achievable given the current rate of progress.
Johnson’s political cowardice applies brake to cheap energy as he bets on nuclear,10,"And from the perspective of energy security – the focus of this policy, don’t forget – offshore’s bigger turbines and higher load factors are always going to score well versus onshore."

Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,0,The novelty song is a dying art form.
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,1,"Deliberately silly, often profoundly annoying earworms by unestablished artists rarely factor into today’s pop universe."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,2,"Instead, they have been replaced by the viral hit: a song by a nascent star that swiftly rises from obscurity to ubiquity, sating the appetite for newness and surprise with a bit more coolness and class."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,3,"Although the viral hit is implicitly attention-grabbing, it doesn’t tend to be gimmicky – usually the accompanying social media craze (TikTok dance, or back in the day, Twitter meme template) takes care of that."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,4,"Occasionally, there comes a viral hit that dances on the edge of novelty territory – comedic, a bit weird and infuriatingly catchy – but, crucially, not without serious musical panache."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,5,"In 2019, that song was Old Town Road, the country-trap smash by Nicki Minaj stan turned musician Lil Nas X."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,6,"Last year, it was minimalist indie number Chaise Longue by Isle of Wight duo Wet Leg, AKA late twentysomethings Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,7,"Over a monotonous bass line and sirening post-punk riff, a deadpan Teasdale intoned a series of non sequiturs – from suggestive Mean Girls quotes (“would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?”) to suggestive allusions to academia (“I went to school and I got the big D”)."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,8,"The chorus – essentially, “on the Chaise Longue” repeated ad infinitum in staccato style – combined with the vaguely gross-out band name sealed its strange, adolescent appeal."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,9,"At 13m Spotify streams, the numbers aren’t exactly at Drivers License levels (that particular viral hit is on more than 1.3bn streams), but the hype Chaise Longue has generated on both sides of the Atlantic is far from negligible – they came second in the BBC’s influential Sound of 2022 poll and have appeared on several late-night US chatshows."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,10,Yet there is a price to pay for such teasing flamboyance.
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,11,"Firstly, you risk being seen as an irritant – I can’t be the only one who found Chaise Longue’s irreverence rather ersatz, and its supposedly witty innuendoes more like sub-Carry On inanity."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,12,"Secondly, you introduce a certain amount of scepticism towards your first proper body of work."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,13,Are Wet Leg just a flash in the pan?
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,14,"While their eponymous debut album will no doubt disappoint fans of endless double entendres, it may just convert the cynics."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,15,"Much like Lil Nas X did with his debut, the pair don’t repeat the style of their brash breakthrough hit, but have instead produced a far more subtle and conventional record."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,16,"Wet Leg – mostly recorded in cocoon-like circumstances before Chaise Longue’s release, with help from producer du jour Dan Carey (Black Midi, Fontaines DC) – is a collection of 90s and 00s-era indie that is by turns dreamy, lush, hooky and thunderous, and layered with lyrics saturated with millennial disaffection, anxiety and overwhelm."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,17,"The tracks that bookend the album are among the best examples of this approach: opener Being in Love – in which a satisfyingly original twist on the idea of infatuation as mental instability is relayed through the medium of scuzzy/delicate rock – and closer Too Late Now, a stormy tribute to opportunities passing you by and alienation setting in."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,18,"The latter has a gratifyingly relatable self-doubt break, when the music drops out to allow Teasdale to document her existential angst as it spreads into the track she is currently performing: “I’m not sure if this is a song / I don’t even know what I’m saying … I’m not sure if this is the kind of life that I saw myself living.” The quarter-life crisis – rendered in messy, anxiety-riven, circular thought patterns – is perhaps the unifying motif of Wet Leg."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,19,"On the psychedelic I Don’t Wanna Go Out, whose recurring riff nods to Bowie’s The Man Who Sold the World, our narrator is “almost 28, still getting off my stupid face.” On Angelica, sourly chiming guitars soundtrack a woman miserably going through the motions at a party; Oh No reflects on the infinite scroll while only just managing to suppress screeching panic."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,20,"There are more in-yer-face tracks – with its hummed bass line and ambling raucousness, Supermarket’s tale of being stoned while doing the big shop recalls first-wave British punk in spirit and subject matter, while Wet Dream archly rejects the idea of being the object of masturbatory fantasies – but there is a maudlin air to these, too."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,21,"The music is more muted and bittersweet than on Chaise Longue, as are the jokes – which actually make sense this time."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,22,"That Teasdale and Chambers are able to treat great lines like throwaway remarks – as on the sweetly incantatory Loving You, which features the jibe: “I hope you choke on your girlfriend” – is proof they have wit to spare."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,23,"You have to concede that in the content-saturated streaming age, arriving with a bit of goonish novelty probably isn’t a bad way to kickstart a career."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,24,"Wet Leg have certainly got people listening, and by channelling their sense of humour and showmanship into a series of tracks that are far more nuanced and three-dimensional than the infuriatingly repetitive song that made their name, they’ve ensured their debut album is well worth hearing – again and again and again."

Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,30,"9 Mount Ida 8yo, 11st 5lb Another member of Elliott’s eight-strong stable , but one of the least convincing candidates to give her trainer a record-equalling fourth success."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,31,Stamina is unlikely to be an issue – she has looked to be crying out for a test like this for much of her career – but her jumping is generally so-so at best and comes with a tendency to veer sharply right.
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,32,"On a left-handed track like Aintree, that could cost her many lengths, and her latest run in the new Mares’ Chase at Cheltenham was a let down."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,33,Easily overlooked.
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,34,"10 Longhouse Poet 8yo, 11st 4lb Martin Brassil hit the bullseye with Numbersixvalverde, his first Grand National runner, in 2006, saddled the same horse to finish sixth a year later and then sent Double Seven to finish third in 2014."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,35,"This is his first National runner since and won the ultra-competitive Thyestes Chase – a race that Numbersixvalverde landed the season before his Aintree win – in January, with several of today’s opponents well beaten."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,36,"As an eight-year-old making just his seventh chase start, he has more scope for improvement than most and at around 16-1 is an excellent bet to further improve Brassil’s excellent record in the world’s most famous steeplechase."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,37,"11 Fiddlerontheroof 8yo 11st 4lb A live candidate to be the best of the British-trained runners, but even that would be no guarantee of an each-way return given the strength of the Irish challenge."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,38,"The eight-year-old’s domestic form is rock-solid, however, and Colin Tizzard also resisted the urge to run him at Cheltenham, despite an excellent run in the Ladbrokes Trophy in November that could have persuaded him to aim at the Gold Cup."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,39,"A sound jumper who goes on any ground, though his stamina is untested at a marathon trip and more dependable stayers can be backed at much the same price."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,40,"12 Two For Gold 9yo, 11st 3lb Beaten less than two lengths in a Grade One race at Ascot last time, which is strong form for a horse getting weight from several of the major fancies."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,41,"That was over two miles and five furlongs, however, and in addition to the question mark over his stamina, the fact he fell on his first attempt over these fences – in the Topham Trophy last season – is another concern."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,42,"Kim Bailey, his trainer, knows what it takes to win this, having saddled Mr Frisk in 1990, but a price of around 40-1 looks fair."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,43,"13 Santini 10yo, 11st 2lb A top-class chaser at his best, who went down by a neck in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March 2020."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,44,"If he has been on the downslope of his career since, it has been a fairly gentle one."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,45,"A change of scenery may have helped, having switched from Nicky Henderson to Polly Gundry over the summer, and he was up with the leaders for much of the way in last month’s renewal."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,46,"One of several who could show up well for a long way if the fences fire him up, while unlikely to maintain his challenge beyond the second-last."

Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,48,"The 10-year-old has had his moments, including three Grade One wins and as Elliott points out, it “would be a Samcro thing to do” to “run a massive race”, but it would be a Samcro thing to finish 16th – as he did on his first start in a handicap chase – and that is the more credible scenario."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,49,"15 Escaria Ten 8yo 11st 1lb Closely matched with Any Second Now on their form in the Bobbyjo Chase in February, when last year’s third gave 8lb to Elliott’s eight-year-old – 1lb more than he will on Saturday – and edged him by a nose."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,50,"The time of that race was notably strong too, and a real step forward from Escaria Ten’s comeback run behind Longhouse Poet in the Thyestes Chase."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,51,He was probably feeling the effects of a big effort at Cheltenham when pulled up in last year’s Irish National and definitely makes the short list.
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,52,"16 Good Boy Bobby 9yo, 10st 13lb Owners Isaac Souede and Simon Munir have four runners and their No 1 rider, Daryl Jacob, has opted to ride this one, though he remains a 33-1 outsider to give them a first National success."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,53,"Won in the Rowland Meyrick Chase at Christmas, while a change of tactics from his usual front-running may be to blame for a lesser run last time."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,54,"Unproven beyond three miles, has a fair bit to find with the market leaders and no obvious reason why he should bridge the gap going up in trip."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,55,"17 Lord Du Mesnil 9yo, 10st 13lb A decent winner of the Grand National Trial at Haydock – on the heavy ground he loves – in February 2021, but his form figures since look more like a bad Scrabble hand, with three Ps and a U."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,56,"Never sighted in last year’s race, on much faster ground, and conditions are against him again this time."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,57,"Would be a cheeky each-way stab if the heavens opened on Friday, but otherwise easily ruled out."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,58,"18 Coko Beach 7yo, 10st 13lb There are several heavyweight contenders in Elliott’s National squad, but Coko Beach fits more snugly into the bantamweight division."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,59,"Seven-year-olds simply don’t win the National these days and while a win in last season’s Thyestes Chase is a plus, he was well beaten off a higher mark in the same race this season."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,60,Appeared to be running on fumes in a three-and-a-half mile race at Punchestown in February – and the National is another six furlongs.

Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,62,His win in the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury in 2019 is one of the best individual pieces of form on offer in this year’s field.
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,63,He will race off the same handicap mark and arrives on the back of an eye-catching run in February’s Denman Chase – his first start for 489 days after a tendon injury.
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,64,Lavelle’s stable is a match for any when it comes to getting a top-notch horse big-race ready and it would be no surprise to see him outrun his odds.
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,65,"20 Kildisart 10yo, 10st 11lb One of the better staying novice chasers in 2018/19, when he also won a handicap on the National undercard, but was off the track for 462 days before returning to action at Newbury in March."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,66,Has always looked likely to improve over a marathon trip but this is a swift return to action after a long break and he was among the potential rides that Daryl Jacob turned down.
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,67,"James Bowen gets the call-up, but his third National ride looks no more likely to prevail than the first two."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,68,"21 Discorama 9yo, 10st 11lb Showed up well for a long way as a 16-1 shot last year and briefly threatened to do even better than his eventual finish in seventh when he moved towards the lead with four to jump."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,69,"In the end, though, his finishing effort was tame, and even the veteran Blaklion managed to breeze past him on the run-in."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,70,"His light schedule this year has clearly been designed with a return to Aintree in mind and co-owner Andrew Gemmell, of Paisley Park fame, has a happy knack of getting involved with fairytale success stories, but 40-1 does not feel unduly generous."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,71,"22 Top Ville Ben 10yo, 10st 11lb Philip Kirby’s gelding should at least get a mention or two from the commentator as a confirmed frontrunner, but shout-outs at the business end will be more a lot more difficult to achieve."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,72,"His first experience over these fences ended with a heavy fall at the 12th fence in the Becher Chase in December and even if that experience has not left a mark, his exuberant running style is likely to see his elastic band fully unwound with a few fences still to jump."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,73,"23 Enjoy D’Allen 8yo, 10st 11lb Few trainers have as much to gain on Saturday as Ciaran Murphy, whose small stable would jump through several leagues if Enjoy D’Allen comes home in front."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,74,"Murphy has been on the staff at Charlestown Stud for 25 years, but took over the licence 15 months ago and has already seen his eight-year-old run third in last season’s Irish National."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,75,"That form gives him a big chance on Saturday, so much so that JP McManus was persuaded to buy a share after a solid prep run."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,76,"“I’ve been thinking about nothing else all year,” he said recently."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,77,“Winning would be off the Richter scale.” Murphy’s gelding is a fair 14-1 shot to record a groundbreaking success.

Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,79,"He also finished fourth on his first startin 2018, but was never going well when attempting to make it third time lucky last season."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,80,"He has shown no more than occasional glimpses of worthwhile form since and while handicap runners from the Tony Martin yard have a reputation for dramatic improvement when the big day arrives, little short of a miracle is requiredfor him to make a mark this time."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,81,"25 Dingo Dollar 10yo, 10st 11lb A change of surroundings made a world of difference to Sandy Thompson’s gelding, who seemed to have peaked as long ago as November 2018, when he was third in the Ladbrokes Trophy for Alan King, but has found a new lease of life in Scotland."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,82,"Runner-up in the Scottish National last April, but yet to recapture that kind of form this year and he did not seem impressed by the Aintree experience in the 2020 Becher Chase."

Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,85,"Run Wild Fred and Enjoy D’Allen, who are at a much shorter price, finished second and third that day so a return to that level would – theoretically, at least – make him a player, but subsequent form suggests it was a flash-in-the-pan moment."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,86,"Sheila Mangan, his owner, backed him at 50-1, 66-1 and then 150-1 – “ah, for feck sake, I have to have a bit of that as well” as she put it – and will presumably do so again now, but only optimists will follow her in."

Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,91,"While Noble Yeats has bits of form to suggest he could be an Aintree horse one day, his debut is probably coming at least a year too soon."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,92,"29 Mighty Thunder 9yo, 10st 10lb Lucinda Russell was the last British trainer to win the National, with One For Arthur five years ago, and her runner this year put down an excellent marker with a doughty success in the 2021 Scottish National, when making his sixth start over fences."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,93,He has failed to build on that and was reported to have suffered a breathing problem in the Edinburgh National in February.
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,94,"Better the further he goes, so the Aintree trip will hold no fears, but an immense leap of faith is required to back him on this year’s form."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,95,"30 Cloth Cap 10yo, 10st 10lb Set off as the much-fancied 11-2 favourite last year and was still chasing the leader five from home, but faded rapidly and was pulled up."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,96,"A breathing problem was diagnosed and he had an operation to address it before returning to action this season, but the old Cloth Cap has yet to reappear."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,97,"He looked like the best-handicapped horse in the field 12 months ago and is rated 1lb lower now at 25-1, but he found very little at the end of the Grimthorpe Chase at Doncaster last time."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,98,"31 Snow Leopardess 10yo, 10st 9lb Charlie Longsdon’s mare has plenty of the attributes you look for in a winner, up to and including Hollywood blockbuster potential – she would be the first mum to win the race."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,99,"Snow Leopardess gave birth to a filly foal during an 18-month absence from the track, but that is just one strand of a remarkable storyline involving her breeder, 80-year-old Marietta Fox-Pitt."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,100,"“I wasn’t any different after I had children,” Fox-Pitt says when asked why she sent Snow Leopardess back into training, “so why should she be?” Recuperated with Marietta’s son, the event rider William Fox-Pitt and his wife, Alice Plunkett, part of the ITV Racing team, so her post-race interview has the potential to be teary TV gold."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,101,Odds of around 9-1 are short enough as she did not have a huge amount to spare at the end of the Becher Chase in December.
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,102,"32 Agusta Gold 9yo, 10st 9lb Like Snow Leopardess, attempting to become the first mare to win the National since Nickel Coin in 1951."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,103,"Unlike Snow Leopardess, she has very little chance of doing so and could well be the weakest link even in Mullins’s sub-par squad for this race."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,104,"33 Phoenix Way 9yo, 10st 9lb Ran in a Grade One novice event at this meeting last year but that was over two-and-a-half miles and extreme distances remain a big unknown over fences."
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,105,"Also a sketchy jumper at times, taking a crunching fall on his latest start at Kempton Park, so an easy runner to dismiss when there are so many better alternatives on offer."

‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,11,"Added to this is the coy acceptance of the problem, “like in Tena ads for your little ‘oops’ moments."

‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,18,"We need to empower women to vocalise when they’re having problems and do something about it.” It’s certainly not a niche concern: as many as one in three women experience urinary incontinence in the three months after childbirth, according to the National Childbirth Trust (NCT)."
‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,19,And it can also develop in the years that follow.
‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,20,"According to Julie Cornish, colorectal consultant at the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and vice-president of the MASIC Foundation – a charity that supports women who have been severely injured during childbirth – research shows that one in five women develop problems controlling their bowels in the first five years after giving birth vaginally."

‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,22,"When the pelvic floor is overstretched – if the baby is large, during an assisted birth (using forceps, for example) or if labour is prolonged – one or more of these organs can descend (prolapse) into the vagina."

‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,27,Postnatal care has long been patchy – even before the pandemic – partly due to a lack of education among healthcare professionals as well as the embarrassment and stigma that impedes mothers from reporting their issues in the first place.
‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,28,"Covid simply exacerbated these underlying fissures, says Cornish: “We are facing a massive uphill battle, because cancer cases are going to be taking priority and so pelvic floor problems get pushed to the back of the queue again.” For the most part, pregnant women are offered some education by the NHS about what to expect all the way through to delivery, but these classes are not uniform across the country."

‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,40,"She rang gynaecology at the hospital, and they said that until the infection had been cleared, they weren’t prepared to see me.” Sweet says that having an open wound that wasn’t healing was more painful than the labour."
‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,41,"“Nobody seemed to know what to do with it, or what should be done to keep the wound clean and who was meant to be reviewing it.” Eventually, after four courses of antibiotics, the infection cleared, but Sweet was told her problem did not satisfy the criteria for urgent referral to gynaecology."

‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,57,"She said, ‘No, it’s really not OK.’” “It was the first time anyone had told me that something was really wrong – I had had a fourth-degree tear that had been missed.” It was likely, she was told, that the tear had occurred back in 2015, during the birth of her first child, when she was given an episiotomy and forceps had been used."

Compartment No 6 review – meet-uncute train romance is a Finnish Before Sunrise,0,"Despite the bone-chilling cold of its location in Murmansk in Russia’s remote north-west, there’s a wonderful human warmth and humour in this offbeat romantic story of strangers on a train."
Compartment No 6 review – meet-uncute train romance is a Finnish Before Sunrise,1,"It comes from Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen, whose 2016 film The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki was a lovely comedy about a real-life Finnish boxing champ in the 1960s."

Compartment No 6 review – meet-uncute train romance is a Finnish Before Sunrise,3,"Under Irina’s tutelage, with her encouragement, and perhaps because this older woman does not care to have Laura hanging around much longer, Laura has resolved to make the tough rail journey up to Murmansk where she wants to view the petroglyphs there - mysterious rock drawings, thousands of years old."

Compartment No 6 review – meet-uncute train romance is a Finnish Before Sunrise,8,"Vadim’s scowling face and shaven, bullet head make him look a tough guy at first, but it isn’t long before we see him as a vulnerable little boy, never more so than when with Laura welcomes another Finnish guy to share their carriage - a self-admiringly sensitive type who insists on singing and playing his guitar."
Compartment No 6 review – meet-uncute train romance is a Finnish Before Sunrise,9,"Vadim is fiercely sceptical and resentful of this preening interloper, and he is right to be."
Compartment No 6 review – meet-uncute train romance is a Finnish Before Sunrise,10,"In the end, no one wants to help Laura find these petroglyphs that she has set her heart on and travelled so far to see, and it is Vadim himself who has to step up; there is charm and gentleness in this scene and the movie as a whole."

"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",0,"Most American gun owners say they own firearms to protect themselves and their loved ones, but a study published this week suggests people who live with handgun owners are shot to death at a higher rate than those who don’t have such weapons at home."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",1,"“We found zero evidence of any kind of protective effects” from living in a home with a handgun, said David Studdert, a Stanford University researcher who was the lead author of the Annals of Internal Medicine study."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",2,"The study followed nearly 600,000 Californians who did not own handguns but began living in homes with handguns between October 2004 and December 2016, either because they started living with someone who owned one or because someone in their household bought one."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",3,"It found that the absolute risk of living with a handgun owner was small, Studdert said, and that “the rates [of homicide] are low”."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",4,"But it was important to consider the increase in a person’s risk of being killed, he added."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",5,"The researchers calculated that for every 100,000 people in that situation, 12 will be shot to death by someone else over five years."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",6,"In comparison, eight out of 100,000 who live in gun-free homes will be killed that way over the same time span."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",7,"Those numbers suggest the risk rises 50%, but Studdert said it was actually higher: in a separate calculation designed to better account for where people live and other factors, the researchers estimated the risk was more than twice as high."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",8,"In particular, the researchers found, people who lived with handgun owners had a much higher rate of being fatally shot by a spouse or intimate partner."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",9,"The vast majority of such victims, 84%, were women, they said."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",10,"Living with a handgun owner particularly increased the risk of being shot to death in a domestic violence incident, and it did not provide any protection against being killed at home by a stranger, the researchers found."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",11,"People who lived with handgun owners “did not experience such fatal [stranger] attacks at lower rates than their neighbors in gun-free homes”, the researchers wrote, noting that stranger homicides at home were “a small minority” of the homicides observed in the study."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",12,"The study focused only on homicide risk and did not examine how living with a handgun owner might increase or decrease the risk of being victimized in other ways, including by nonfatal assault, home invasion, or property theft."

"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",14,"That allowed the researchers to follow millions of people over many years to try to better establish what happened when a person began living in a home with a handgun, they said."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",15,The authors of the study acknowledged it had several shortcomings.
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",16,"For example, the researchers said they could not determine which victims had been killed by the handgun owners or with the in-home weapons."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",17,"They couldn’t account for illegal guns and looked only at handguns, not rifles or other firearms."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",18,The dataset also was limited to registered voters in California who were 21 and older.
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",19,"It’s not clear that the findings are generalizable to the whole state, let alone to the rest of the country."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",20,"But some outside experts said the work was well done, important and the largest research of its kind."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",21,"“I would call this a landmark study,” said Cassandra Crifasi, a gun violence policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",22,"“This contributes to our understanding of the potential causal relationship between guns in the home and homicides.” The study was confined to California, but the risk was probably even greater in states with less stringent gun laws and where gun ownership was more common, Crifasi said."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",23,The results of the study come as the United States has experienced a dramatic increase in gun ownership during the pandemic.
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",24,"Previous research estimated that nearly 3% of US adults had become new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021, which translates to about 7.5 million Americans."

"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",26,"An early study of pandemic gun purchases found that there was no clear association between the increase in gun-buying and the increase in most kinds of interpersonal firearm violence in 2020, when a surge in gun violence drove a nearly 30% increase in the national murder rate."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",27,"For decades, studies have shown guns in the home raise the risk of a violent death."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",28,"Much of that work, including an earlier study by Studdert and his colleagues, focused on suicide."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",29,"The new study goes further in addressing the perception that handguns are still worthwhile because of the safety they provide against being murdered, some experts said."
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",30,"“The reason people have guns in their home is for protection from strangers,” said David Hemenway, director of Harvard University’s Injury Control Research Center."

Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,0,"You don’t need to prove you have been vaccinated to get into the Masters this year, don’t need to show a negative test or wear a face covering."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,1,"“Feels like a normal Masters again,” said Rory McIlroy."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,2,"And he’s right, around about here it’s almost like the past two years never happened."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,3,Almost.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,4,There is one big little difference.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,5,They’re all out of Georgia peach ice cream sandwiches at the concession stands.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,6,Serious business this.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,7,"The sandwiches were the outstanding achievement of the last Augusta National chairman, Billy Payne, and all the justification needed to explain his induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,8,"Payne’s successor, Fred Ridley, was asked about them on Wednesday morning, and replied, with appropriate gravitas: “We have encountered supply chain issues, just like everyone, in everything we’ve done.” Ridley talked through a couple of other changes, trivial things in comparison, such as the major renovations to the course."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,9,"According to McIlroy, the 11th “is basically a new hole”, and the 15th is different, too."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,10,The club have lengthened both.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,11,"At 11 they have extended the pond, removed one group of the trees and planted another further down the right side of the fairway and at 15 they have reshaped the green."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,12,"They often tinker with the course, but these changes are a little more drastic than usual, the idea, as always, is to make sure it is still a course that offers the right balance between risk and reward."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,13,What the club have not done is the one change everyone was expecting them to make at the 13th.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,14,"The club’s co-founder Bobby Jones loved that hole, which he said offers players “a tempting and dangerous” decision about whether to bend the tee-shot around the corner so they can reach the green in two."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,15,"At least, that’s what it’s supposed to do."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,16,These days the 13th feels toothless.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,17,The players hit it so long off the tee they are left with a short iron into the green.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,18,"The club bought a patch of land behind the tee-box off the neighbouring Augusta Country Club, which everyone assumed meant they were going to be able to lengthen the hole."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,19,They haven’t done it yet.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,20,Ridley knows there is a problem.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,21,The club have been talking for years about fixing it and he reiterated it on Wednesday.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,22,"“The 13th hole does not have the same challenges that it had historically.” The reason they are reluctant to do anything about it, he said, is that it’s such a classic hole."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,23,"“Probably along with 12, and maybe 15, those three holes are where the most history has been made at Augusta National.” It is where Arnold Palmer made an eagle with a second ball after a long dispute with a rules official when he won in 1958; where Curtis Strange blew a two-shot Sunday lead by hitting it into the creek in 1985; and where Jack Nicklaus picked up a crucial birdie in ’86."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,24,"“I can just remember as a young guy watching the Masters, some of the triumphs and tragedies there,” Ridley said."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,25,“So that probably has been a counter to doing anything.” The worry is they will end up like the one of those amateur artists who decides it is a good idea to try to touch up a fading masterpiece.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,26,Ridley is clearly daunted by the prospect of tampering with it.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,27,And maybe he is right to be.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,28,"The club have always caught between the old and the new, the desire to do right by the traditions, and to keep improving, too."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,29,There are times when they do get it wrong.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,30,Ridley’s recent decision to allow the media group Dude Perfect to shoot a YouTube film with Bryson DeChambeau at Amen Corner felt like a misstep.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,31,Ridley was asked how he imagined Jones would feel if he came back to see Augusta.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,32,"“I hope he would be proud,” he said."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,33,“I hope that he would feel that we continue to carry the tradition and values we thought were so important in the game.” Just so long as he wasn’t here the day DeChambeau was tossing Frisbees around Amen Corner for the sake of a viral video.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,34,"But Ridley said, Dude Perfect “has 57 million followers on YouTube and that got my attention”."
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,35,The clip ended up “the No 1 YouTube video at the time”.
Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,36,That is quite a change for a club who refused to televise the front nine for so many years.

This Woman’s Work edited by Kim Gordon and Sinéad Gleeson review – ‘Music undoes me’,23,"If this all sounds a little serious, let me point you towards the Irish novelist Anne Enright whose Fan Girl finds her reflecting on the “beautiful disaster” that unfolded one day in New York when she met the artist and musician Laurie Anderson."
This Woman’s Work edited by Kim Gordon and Sinéad Gleeson review – ‘Music undoes me’,24,"Enright’s brain suddenly seemed to disengage from her mouth, rendering her incapable of saying anything other than “a single gloop of word-sentence-blurt”, which she renders as “fiffloopidiggllyblop”."
This Woman’s Work edited by Kim Gordon and Sinéad Gleeson review – ‘Music undoes me’,25,"She may have failed to form coherent sentences in Anderson’s presence, but she makes up for it in a lively and entertaining piece that paints the artist as a trailblazer, mischief-maker, kindred spirit and personal hero whose haircut Enright flagrantly copied."
This Woman’s Work edited by Kim Gordon and Sinéad Gleeson review – ‘Music undoes me’,26,"As the title suggests, the author makes no bones about being a “fan girl”, a pejorative term invariably used to separate serious male musical appreciation from music-loving girls supposedly driven by idolatry."
This Woman’s Work edited by Kim Gordon and Sinéad Gleeson review – ‘Music undoes me’,27,"Enright notes how she has strived to avoid what she calls “the music conversation, the one where people gather into tribes, swap favourites, judge, include, exclude, bond, claim status or coolness or an identity because of their choices."

Julia review – larger-than-life US cookery queen offers self-indulgent rhapsodising,0,Here is a celebratory documentary that takes for granted throughout that its audience is already hugely invested in its subject: the American TV chef and larger-than-life personality Julia Child.
Julia review – larger-than-life US cookery queen offers self-indulgent rhapsodising,1,She is sufficiently legendary in the United States to have rated a biopic impersonation by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie &amp; Julia and also by Britain’s Sarah Lancashire in the recent HBO TV series Julia (alongside an otherwise largely American cast).
Julia review – larger-than-life US cookery queen offers self-indulgent rhapsodising,2,"Added to which, Dan Aykroyd once did a Julia Child sketch on Saturday Night Live and David Cross in the TV comedy Arrested Development did a whooping Julia Child voice when he dressed up as a Mrs Doubtfire nanny."
Julia review – larger-than-life US cookery queen offers self-indulgent rhapsodising,3,"As for this documentary, it’s a professionally made film with reasonable things to say about the birth of TV celebrity chef culture, challenging male dominance in the professional kitchen and Child’s role in promoting the pre-eminence of French cuisine among America’s emerging food-literate middle classes."
Julia review – larger-than-life US cookery queen offers self-indulgent rhapsodising,4,"But just as with that Meryl Streep movie, I found myself restless at the parochiality of this American icon, although the film does briefly ponder the French public’s lack of interest in her."

Julia review – larger-than-life US cookery queen offers self-indulgent rhapsodising,11,But that had a story to tell that reached out beyond the fanbase.

What would following Australia’s ‘leadership’ on the climate crisis actually look like?,39,Lomborg told Temperature Check his description of the $9.2tn figure as a cost was “similar to how Bloomberg describes the report with its headline “McKinsey Pegs the Price Tag of a Livable Climate at $9.2 Trillion a Year”.
What would following Australia’s ‘leadership’ on the climate crisis actually look like?,40,"He said: “We get both energy, jobs, and zero CO₂ emissions for this cost, but this is what is normally understood to come along with the cost of a policy.” Lomborg also argued McKinsey’s reference to the additional cost being as low as $1tn a year was across two scenarios that were not comparable because they assumed different energy outputs."
What would following Australia’s ‘leadership’ on the climate crisis actually look like?,41,"McKinsey rejected this claim, saying “the relevant metric is not total energy output, but rather the ability to meet the world’s energy needs.” McKinsey added it was “incomplete to consider those [$9.2tn] costs in a vacuum without mention of the anticipated benefits of the policies”."
What would following Australia’s ‘leadership’ on the climate crisis actually look like?,42,"“For this reason, we urge consideration of the benefits alongside the costs so a more informed decision on the value of the investment can be made.” Lomborg claimed it was “absolutely relevant” to “highlight the cost per family” because he claimed the spending “can only be shouldered by Americans”."
What would following Australia’s ‘leadership’ on the climate crisis actually look like?,43,McKinsey said framing the spending as a cost to individual families “misstates the distribution of costs and unfairly leaves out the value of the benefits” to families.
