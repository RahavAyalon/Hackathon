"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",1,"As the highly transmissible Omicron variant shot to dominance towards the end of last year, it emerged that, while it is better at dodging the body’s immune responses than Delta, it also produces less severe disease."
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",2,"Now a large study has not only backed up the findings, but confirmed reports Omicron is linked to a shorter duration of illness and a different collection of symptoms."
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",3,"The study comes just days after the NHS added nine further symptoms for Covid to its existing list of fever, a new and persistent cough, and a loss or change in taste or smell."
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",4,The researchers found people who had Covid when Omicron was prevalent were about half as likely to report having at least one of the latter three symptoms as those who had Covid when Delta was rife.
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",5,"“It is a lesson that we need to be far more flexible in thinking what the virus is and how it is going to present than we have been, certainly in the UK,” said Prof Tim Spector, co-author of the research from King’s College London, adding that the team showed data to the government around five months ago that showed a sore throat was replacing loss of smell as a symptom."
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",6,"The study, which is to be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases and has been published in the Lancet, is based on data from 63,002 participants of the Zoe Covid study."
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",7,"The researchers matched almost 4,990 participants who had a confirmed Covid infection between 1 June and 27 November 2021 – when Delta was the most prevalent variant – with 4,990 individuals who reported an infection between 20 December 2021 and 17 January 2022 when Omicron dominated, with the matching based on age, sex and whether they had received two or three vaccine doses."
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",8,The experience of both groups were then compared.
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",9,"The team found participants’ symptoms lasted on average 6.9 days during the period when Omicron dominated, compared with 8.9 days when Delta dominated, with infections during the Omicron period linked to a 25% lower likelihood of admission to hospital."
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",10,"The results suggested only 17% of people who had Covid when Omicron dominated lost their sense of smell, compared with 53% when Delta dominated."
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",11,"However, a sore throat and going hoarse were both more common among the former."
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",12,Spector said the symptom-logging approach used in the research was an invaluable tool.
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",13,"“[It] should alert us what to look out for when there will inevitably be the next variant,” he said, adding action needs to be quicker in the future."

"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",17,"“People in hospital are staying in hospital for longer and staff are testing positive for longer, so it is longer before they can return to work,” he said."

Johnson’s political cowardice applies brake to cheap energy as he bets on nuclear,9,The target may even be achievable given the current rate of progress.
Johnson’s political cowardice applies brake to cheap energy as he bets on nuclear,10,"And from the perspective of energy security – the focus of this policy, don’t forget – offshore’s bigger turbines and higher load factors are always going to score well versus onshore."
