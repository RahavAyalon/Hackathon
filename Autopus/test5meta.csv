Russia-Ukraine war latest: Kremlin admits ‘significant’ troop losses; Russia suspended from UN human rights council – live,2022-04-07T04:28:26Z,"Maanvi Singh (now);  Joanna Walters, Léonie Chao-Fong, Martin Belam and Samantha Lock (earlier)",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mt3,"Canada has earmarked an additional 1b Canadian dollars in loans and 500m in military aid to Ukraine. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said that “Putin’s assault has been so vicious that we all now understand that the world’s democracies - including our own - can be safe only if the Russian tyrant and his criminal armies are entirely vanquished,” in a speech to parliament. “It is in our urgent national interest to ensure they have the missiles and the money they need to win,” she said. So far, Canada has offered $90m in military aid $180 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Britain is preparing to announce a fresh package of military aid for Ukraine and has demonstrated new missile systems and armoured vehicles that it believes can help Kyiv in the next phases of fighting. Junior defence ministers Jeremy Quin and James Heappey invited Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Volodymyr Havrylov to Salisbury Plain on Wednesday, where they discussed what extra weapons the UK could supply. “It was an honour to show Minister Havrylov and his generals the kit the UK hopes to provide next and to discuss some new weapons that have been trialled recently with UK forces,” Heappey said. The army and Royal Marines demonstrated a range of equipment and “options for further military support”, which, the Ministry of Defence said, included “defensive missile systems and protected mobility vehicles”. The protected mobility vehicle is thought to refer to the Mastiff, a heavily armoured patrol vehicle, first deployed in Afghanistan, which would help Ukraine’s forces achieve greater manoeuvrability against Russian attacks in the eastern Donbas. Read more: The European Union is proposing a 500m euro military aid package to Ukraine. AFP reports: European Council chief Charles Michel on Thursday backed a proposal to release an additional 500m euros ($540m) to provide arms for Ukraine. “Once swiftly approved this will bring to 1.5b euros the EU support already provided for military equipment for Ukraine,” Michel tweeted, also thanking EU diplomatic chief Josep Borrell for proposing the extra funding. The proposal was agreed on Thursday by the 27 EU nations at ambassador level. The EU has already agreed a 1b euro package to provide arms for Kyiv. “This may seem like a lot, but one billion euros is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us,” Borrell said on Wednesday. The money comes from a 5 billion euro European peace fund set up by members states. In his latest address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that the “Russian state and the Russian military are the greatest threat on the planet to freedom, to human security, to the concept of human rights.” In Mariupol, he said, “the same cruelty, the same heinous crimes” that occurred in , in Bucha and in the Kyiv region” are being replicated: More and more information is coming in that Russian propagandists are preparing, so to speak, a “mirror response” to the shock of all normal people from what they saw in Bucha. They are going to show the victims in Mariupol as if they were killed not by the Russian military, but by the Ukrainian defenders of the city. To do this, the occupiers collect corpses on the streets, take them out and can use them elsewhere in accordance with the elaborated propaganda scenarios. We are dealing with invaders who have nothing human left. To justify their own killings, they take the murdered people simply as scenery, as propaganda props. And this is a separate war crime, for which each of the propagandists will be held accountable. Soldiers fighting for Ukraine appear to shoot a Russian prisoner of war outside a village west of Kyiv in a video posted online. The footage was originally shared on social media app Telegram. The New York Times said it had verified the video and the BBC said it had confirmed the location north of the town of Dmytrivka and found satellite images showing bodies on the ground. In the video, at least three men in camouflage, including one with a head wound and his hands tied behind his back, can be seen lying dead next to a fourth man, who is breathing heavily with a jacket covering his head. “He’s still alive. Film these marauders. Look, he’s still alive. He’s gasping,” a man in the video can be heard saying in Russian – a language widely spoken in Ukraine. A soldier then shoots him in the head twice. He continues to move, so the soldier shoots again, and he stops. A soldier can then be heard shouting “Glory to Ukraine”. A man responds with the phrase: “Glory to heroes.” The audio ends with a man saying: “Do not [expletive] come to our land.” The living soldiers in the video are wearing the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow on their arms, while the men on the floor wear white armbands, the colour of Russian troops. A few metres away from the bodies is a BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicle which is used by the Russian airborne unit. BBC investigators attempted to biometrically match the face of one of the men in the video, who can be seen facing the camera with a distinctive beard. They found a match to a Georgian man with close links to Ukraine, but are yet to confirm his identity. The broadcaster believes the word “Gruziny” – which means Georgians in Russian – can also be heard. Scenes in the video match the scenery on Google Street View of the main road outside Dmytrivka, which is about seven miles south-west of Bucha with roads to Irpin. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Thursday he was aware of the video and it would “definitely be investigated”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he had not seen the video, but stated: “I will say that every report on potential violations of international law should be followed or looked into, and of course, any violation of international law and any war crime is always unacceptable.” A war crime is defined by the United Nations as a serious breach of international law committed against civilians or enemy forces during an armed conflict.

Reuters reports: Lying on plastic mattresses, hundreds of Ukrainians including families waited in a crowded shelter run by the local government in the Mexican border city of Tijuana this week. Enrique Lucero, director of the city’s immigration services, said about 2,829 Ukrainians were waiting, more than double the 1,200 counted last Friday. Nearly two-thirds of them were in shelters, with the rest in hotels and churches, he said. The number of Ukrainians at the border is also increasing as US processing of claims fails to keep up with new arrivals, he said. Lucero said that US authorities had promised to speed up asylum applications to process up to 578 a day. The US government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Having housed Haitians and Central Americans who arrived in caravans in 2018, the Benito Juarez sports center once again became an emergency shelter over the weekend. Joe Biden said late last month his country would receive up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. The Nobel laureate editor-in-chief of the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta was attacked with red paint while he was on a train, he said. The investigative newspaper suspended publishing until the end of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after Russia’s communications regulator warned them to cease its reporting. Muratov appears to have been attacked while he was in the sleeping compartment of a train, in pictures posted to Telegram and Twitter. “They poured oil paint with acetone all over the compartment. Eyes burning badly,” Muratov said. The US congress has approved one measure to remove Russia’s “most favored nation” trade status and another to ban oil imports from Russia. Joe Biden is expected to sign both measures into law. The measure amending Russia’s trade status clears the way for the Biden administration to raise tariffs on Russian imports. “Putin must absolutely be held accountable for the detestable, despicable war crimes he is committing against Ukraine” said senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “This package is about bringing every tool of economic pressure to bear onVladimir Putin and his oligarch cronies, said Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “Putin’s Russia does not deserve to be a part of the economic order that has existed since the end of World War Two.” Also in the committee hearing in Washington on Thursday, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said that Moscow has, essentially, stopped taking Washington’s calls on military matters and there had been no dialogue between the two countries since mid-February. “We’ve not been very successful because the Russians have not responded,” Austin said, declaring himself disappointed at the situation. But he added: “Based upon what they’ve done, nothing surprises me. And it doesn’t mean that we’ll stop reaching out to engage them Austin chimed with Milley on grim prospects for the south-east of Ukraine at this point. But he asserted that Russian president Vladimir Putin has given up on capturing the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. “Putin thought that he could very rapidly take over the country of Ukraine, very rapidly capture this capital city, he was wrong,” Austin said. He added: “Putin has probably has given up on that.” The top of the US military top brass testified in Congress earlier on Thursday and the head figure of General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had grim warnings for the millions desperately hoping Russian president Vladimir Putin sees sense and stop the attack on Ukraine. “Ideally, Putin decides to cease fire, stops his aggression, and there’s some sort of diplomatic intervention, but right now that doesn’t look like it’s on the immediate horizon. It’s going to be a long slog,” Milley told the US Senate armed services committee in a hearing in Washington, DC. Bearing in mind that regional leaders are begging remaining residents in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine to leave while they have a “last chance” before an expected renewed Russian offensive, Milley added his voice to warnings. “There’s a significant battle yet ahead down in the south-east, down around the Donbas region where the Russians intend to amass forces and continue their assault,” he told the panel. The US and NATO did not agree to supply fighter jets to Ukraine or other heavy weaponry, and did not step in to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine because of the stated risk that the west could be drawn into a direct war with Russia in that situation. But Milley said the US and its allies have delivered around 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons systems and 60,000 anti-tank systems. This has helped Ukraine prevent Putin’s forces from achieving air superiority, despite Russia’s devastating bombardment of parts of the country. A Ukrainian official is warning residents in the east that they have a “last chance” to flee before a major Russian offensive expected in the Donbas region, AFP writes. These few days may be the last chance to leave” and Russia was “trying to cut off all possible ways of getting people out,” Sergiy Gaiday, governor of the Lugansk region, part of the Donbas, where the city of Severodonetsk is coming under sustained artillery and rocket fire. However, trains evacuating residents are halted by Russian strikes on the only line still under Kyiv’s control, the head of the Ukrainian rail operator, Oleksandr Kamychin, said, describing it as a lifeline for tens of thousands. The enemy carried out strikes on the rail line next to the station in Barbenkovo on the Donetsk line,” he said in a post on the messaging service Telegram. “We’re waiting for the end of the bombardments to clarify the situation. The passengers on these trains have been moved into the station until this is done,” he said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Cyprus to revoke passports issued to Russians through an investment scheme and stop relevant private yachts docking in its marinas. Zelenskiy made the plea during an address to the Cypriot parliament via live video link, the latest in a series of such speeches he has made to foreign legislatures after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. I’m grateful to you for your moral stance. You reacted to the Russian invasion and banned the docking of Russian ships in your ports... ...Stop Russian golden passports, dual citizenship. Except those where there is evidence they do not harm Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. He said that Cyprus has “tools to pressure” its traditionally close friend Russia, and urged Cypriot authorities to “close the ports” to all Russian private yachts. He called on the Cypriots to revoke passports issued to wealthy Russians under the disgraced citizenship-for-investment scheme shut down under corruption allegations in November 2020. After attending the session, Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades told reporters that instructions were given for revocation of four passports of Russians on the European Union’s sanctions list. During the investment scheme, Cyprus issued hundreds of passports to Russian nationals and their families. In November 2020, the Mediterranean island dropped the initiative after Al Jazeera aired a documentary showing reporters posing as fixers for a Chinese businessman seeking a Cypriot passport despite having a criminal record. A public inquiry found that around half of the 6,779 passports issued under the programme were granted illegally. Cyprus, a European Union member, allowed investors to acquire a passport in exchange for an investment of $2.5 million euros (US $3 million). During the 20-minute speech, a short video showed bomb-scarred cities like Mariupol and the bodies of Ukrainian civilians. Cyprus has sent more than 215 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, its largest contribution overseas. It has also received around 10,000 Ukrainian refugees in a country with a relatively large Russian diaspora. A protest against the war took place outside parliament during the session. At least one person was killed and 14 wounded in shelling on Ukraine’s northeastern city of Kharkiv earlier today, the regional governor Oleh Synehubov said in an online video address, Reuters reports. The Ukrainian military earlier said Russian troops were bombarding the city with shells and rockets. Russia denies targeting civilians. We’ll have more on this shortly. But Synehubov has accused the Russians of pounding civilian infrastructure. Earlier, Russia’s defence ministry had said it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the southeast of the country. When this report came out about 11 hours ago, there was no independent verification of the news. Details are sparse. But we’ll bring you more on what Oleh Synehubov has said as soon as we get it. It is just past 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: The Kremlin has admitted suffering “significant losses” of troops since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, in a rare admission of how badly the war has gone. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said he hoped the besieged city of Mariupol would be “liberated from nationalistic battalions” sooner rather than later. A Russian airstrike on a railway near Barvinkove station in Donetsk Oblast has blocked three evacuation trains from leaving, according to reports. Thousands of passengers who were meant to be evacuated on the trains have been placed at the station, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in Borodyanka, a town about 25km west of Bucha. She did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but accused Russian troops of carrying out airstrikes on the town, which is being searched by Ukrainian authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. The Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, says more than 100,000 people still urgently need to be evacuated from the city. Speaking on national television, he described the situation in the Russian-besieged Ukrainian port city as a humanitarian catastrophe. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on the Greek parliament to use its influence to rescue the remaining population in Mariupol, which has had large ethnic Greek populations for centuries. The United Nations general assembly has voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the US-led motion, while 24 countries voted against and 58 countries abstained. Russia will probably renew its attack on Kyiv if it succeeds in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Hruzevych, said. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, earlier today warned that Russian forces were biding their time as Moscow ramped up intelligence operations there and learned how best to fight Ukrainian troops. The mayor of Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, has urged women, children and the elderly to leave because fighting with Russia is expected to intensify in eastern regions. Filatov’s warnings follow similar calls by authorities in the Luhansk region, east of Dnipro. On Wednesday, the regional governor of Luhansk urged all residents to evacuate while they still could in relative safety. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said allies had agreed to strengthen support for Ukraine, and was providing “a wide range” of weapon systems, as well as cybersecurity assistance and equipment to protect against chemical and biological threats. There was no sign Vladimir Putin intended to pull back, he added. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called for more heavy weaponry from western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow, warning: “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late, and many people will die.” G7 foreign ministers condemned “in the strongest terms” the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns. In a joint statement, ministers spoke of “haunting” photographs of mutilated bodies, alleged executions and reports of sexual assaults by Russian troops. German intelligence agencies have intercepted radio messages from Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in Ukraine, according to reports. Two separate communications are said to have been intercepted, in which Russian soldiers describe how they question soldiers as well as civilians, and then proceed to shoot them, the Washington Post cited an intelligence official as saying. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my US colleague, Joanna Walters. Thank you for reading. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in the town of Borodyanka, around 25km west of Bucha, Reuters reports. She did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but accused Russian troops of carrying out airstrikes on the town, which is being searched by Ukrainian authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew. Speaking in a televised briefing, Venediktova said: Borodyanka is the worst in terms of destruction and in terms of the uncertainty about [the number of] victims. On Tuesday, Venediktova said the number of victims in Borodyanka would be higher than anywhere else, but did not provide further details. The Kremlin has admitted suffering “significant losses” of troops since Russia invaded Ukraine, in a rare admission of how badly the war has gone. In an interview with Sky News, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was asked whether the war had amounted to a humiliation for Russia given the number of troops lost. Peskov replied: We have significant losses of troops. And it’s a huge tragedy for us. He did not specific a casualty toll. In late March, Russia said it had lost 1,351 soldiers, with another 3,825 wounded. By contrast, a senior Nato official estimated in late March that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in four weeks of fighting in Ukraine. Peskov said Russia was “sorry” about its suspension from the UN’s human rights council over its invasion of Ukraine, adding: We’ll continue to defend our interests using every possible legal means. He also insisted Russian forces were “never shelling civilian objects” since the beginning of the war, claiming: They were just aiming and using high-precision missiles to attack military infrastructure in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesman also claimed that the horrifying images that have emerged from Bucha over the last week were “fabricated and fake”. When asked if he realised “how grotesque” that sounded, Peskov replied: It’s a bold fake and we’ve been speaking about that for a couple of days but no one would listen to us. The aggressive debunking of “fakes” has become a key component of Russia’s propaganda war in Ukraine. A Russian airstrike on a railway near Barvinkove station in Donetsk Oblast has blocked three evacuation trains from leaving, according to reports. Thousands of passengers who were meant to be evacuated on the trains have been placed at the station, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. It was the only Ukrainian-controlled railway exit from the northern part of Donetsk region, according to reports. From Ukrainian MP, Lesia Vasylenko: Note: the Guardian has not yet been able to verify these reports. Here’s more on the UN general assembly vote to suspend Russia from the UN’s human rights council. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the resolution and 58 countries abstained. Twenty-four member countries voted against the motion, including Belarus, China, Iran, Russia and Syria. Here’s the full list: It is almost 7.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain.

Russia will likely renew its attack on Kyiv if it succeeds in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Hruzevych, said. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, earlier today warned that Russian forces were biding their time as Moscow ramped up intelligence operations there and learned how best to fight Ukrainian troops.

I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, reporting from London, I’ll continue to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, is being interviewed by Sky News, which asked him whether Russia was determined to take the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol “whatever the cost of human life”. Peskov replied: Mariupol is going to liberated from nationalistic battalions. We hope it will happen sooner rather than later. He reiterated Russia’s claim that the maternity ward bombing in Mariupol last month was “fake”. The hospital was a fake hospital. It was a fake and we have very serious reasons to believe that it was a fake. At least four people were reportedly killed and 16 injured in the Russian bombing of the children’s hospital and maternity ward, including a child, prompting outrage from Ukrainians and the world. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he was “grateful” to UN member states who “chose the right side of history” and voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Kuleba said: War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. The United Nations general assembly has voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the US-led motion, while 24 countries voted against and 58 countries abstained. In a draft of the resolution, the 193-member general assembly expressed “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine”, particularly at reports of rights abuses by Russia. In a video address to the Greek parliament, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on the country to use its influence to rescue the remaining population in the devastated city of Mariupol, Reuters reports. Some 100,000 people are still trapped in Mariupol, Zelenskiy told Greek lawmakers, urging: We must save whoever we can. The Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Odesa, which both have had large ethnic Greek populations for centuries, needed “immediate assistance”, he said. Please use your influence as EU members to better organise whatever rescue can be carried out in Mariupol. He also called for stronger bans on Russian banks and tankers, urging the EU to “shut the door” so Russian banks could not make money on the global credit system. Zelenskiy received a standing ovation in parliament at the close of his speech, which was boycotted by the Greek communists and a small nationalist party. Earlier today, Greece’s foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Athens would call on the international criminal court (ICC) to investigate “crimes of war” in Mariupol, telling reporters: Greece has a specific, special interest for Mariupol because of the existence of a 100,000 and more Greek community in Mariupol. The World Health Organization (WHO) is preparing for possible “chemical assaults” in Ukraine, the body’s European head, Hans Kluge, said, Reuters reports. Speaking during a briefing from Lviv, Ukraine, he said: Given the uncertainties of the current situation, there are no assurances that the war will not get worse. WHO is considering all scenarios and making contingencies for different situations that could afflict the people of Ukraine, from the continued treatment of mass casualties, to chemical assaults. Kluge declined to give further details about the WHO’s preparations. Asked about a possible Russian chemical attack on Ukraine, he responded: The short answer is that WHO is preparing for any eventuality within our mandate. Our foreign correspondent Luke Harding interviews a witness to the bombing of Mariupol’s drama theatre who fled by swimming along the shoreline to reach Ukrainian-controlled territory. Dmitry Yurin was at home on 16 March when a Russian bomb struck Mariupol’s drama theatre. His flat in Prospect Mira was a couple of hundred metres away, across a square with a fountain. The theatre had become a capacious air raid shelter. Hundreds of women and children were inside. “It was terrible, a massive blast, an enormous explosion. I heard cries and screams,” Yurin said. I saw bodies and bits of bodies. I pulled one woman out, then a girl, and then a boy. All were hurt. The boy’s legs didn’t move. He was screaming. My hands were shaking. I was covered in blood. Nearby a woman lay motionless on the ground. Family members were desperately attempting to resuscitate her, pressing on her chest. They were trying to bring her back. There was a child standing next to her, saying: ‘Mum, don’t sleep.’ The woman was dead. The exact number of people who perished in the Russian airstrike is still unknown. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says 300 people were killed. Witnesses including Yurin confirm there were dozens of bodies. They say continuous Russian shelling made rescue work dangerous. Yurin said he went back to the garage where he had been sheltering with his mother, Nadezhda, lit a cigarette and swallowed some tablets. He decided he had to get out of Mariupol, which for two gruesome weeks Russian forces had attacked and besieged. The city was cut off from all directions. He came up with an extraordinary plan. Yurin decided he would swim to safety. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, was speaking earlier to reporters after meeting with Nato foreign ministers in Brussels, where he urged weapons to be sent to Kyiv now or “your help will come too late”, AFP reports. Kuleba said: Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks, or your help will come too late, and many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed. Exactly because this help came too late. He said he had “no doubts” that Ukraine would have the weapons necessary to fight. The question is the timeline. This discussion is not about the list of weapons. The discussion is about the timeline. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, is addressing the media after today’s meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. He warned the war could last for years, and said the key to an early solution was down to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said: The easiest way to end this war is for President Putin to pull back all its troops, and to end the war, and to sit down and engage in in serious diplomatic efforts to find the solution. But we need to be realistic, and we have no indications that President Putin has changed his over overall goal, and that is to control Ukraine and to achieve significant military victories on the battleground. What we see is Russian regrouping and repositioning their forces moving out of northern Ukraine, but at the same time moving those forces to the east and we expect a big battle in Donbas. And that’s the reason why allies also highlighted today the urgency of providing more support to Ukraine. That’s the reason why also allies are imposing heavy costs on President Putin and Russia. But at the same time, we are prepared for the long haul. This war may last for weeks, but also months, and possibly also for years. And therefore we need to prepare for a lot more. He also warned that as long as the war continued, there would be a risk of the war escalating, saying: If the war is going to drag on then the risk is first and foremost for the people of Ukraine who will suffer more, we’ll see more damage, more death and more destruction. But of course, as long as the war continues, there will be a risk for escalation beyond the Ukraine. And that’s exactly what Nato is focused on, to prevent that escalation. There are two areas where the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has been saying he is unable to provide more detail. Firstly, this is on the exact nature of weapon supplies to Ukraine. He was keen to paint a picture of continuing support of Ukraine from Nato since 2014. I fully understand that you’re asking specific questions about specific types of weapons. At the same time, I think it’s important to understand that I believe it is better often to not be specific exactly about what kind of systems, but rest assured allies are providing a wide range of different weapons systems. Nato have supported Ukraine for many years since the illegal annexation of Crimea and Russia’s first invasion in 2014 also into Donbas. Nato allies and Nato have provided significant support with equipment with training tens of thousand of soldiers. And then when we saw the intelligence indicating a highly likely invasion we stepped up last autumn. He was then asked a specific question about a video that has emerged which appears to show Ukrainian forces shooting a Russian soldier who has been captured. Stoltenberg said he was unfamiliar with the specific video, but said: I will say that every report on potential violations of international law should be followed or looked into, and of course, any violation of international law and any war crime is always unacceptable. On the global and long-lasting impact of Russia’s aggression, Stoltenberg said: What is happening in Ukraine is being closely watched around the world. We have seen that China is unwilling to condemn Russia’s aggression. And Beijing has joined Moscow in questioning the right of nations to choose their own path. This is a serious challenge. The sanctions introduced by Nato allies and our partners are unprecedented, and they are damaging. He said that Nato’s new strategy would take into account this global shift and “deliver a response on how we relate to Russia in the future”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that some of the package to help “brave Ukrainians” to “defend their homes and the country and push back the invading forces” included “stepping up humanitarian aid and financial support”. He said: We discussed what more we will do, including cybersecurity assistance, and providing the equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical and biological threats. Jens Stoltenberg has announced that Nato will be making moves to provide more support to Georgia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. For Georgia, we could increase our support through the substantial Nato Georgia package, including in areas like situational awareness, secure communications, and cyber. For Bosnia-Herzegovina. We could develop a new defence capacity-building package, and assistance will be tailored, demand-driven, and delivered with the full consent of the countries concerned. He stressed that nations such as Finland, Sweden, Georgia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Australia and Japan, all non-Nato members, were at the meeting because Russia’s actions had a global security impact. Jens Stoltenberg is talking now. The video feed should be available above. The secretary general of Nato has started by saying that the organisation will do more now, and for the medium and longer term to support Ukraine. I will bring you the key quotes and lines. Turkey has been attempting to play a mediating role in events. It hosted a round of face-to-face peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and this morning also hosted a video call with countries that border the Black Sea about the security situation there. Now the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has said that he will be heading to Washington. Reuters reports he told the media after today’s Nato meeting that he had been invited by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to visit for talks on 18 May. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will be giving a press briefing shortly. We will have a live video stream embedded in the blog. You may need to refresh the page and press play in order to see it. Dmytro Kuleba has also told the media that the discussion at Nato was not about the list of weapons Ukraine would get, but rather about the timeline for when they would be given. The Ukrainian foreign minister said that he had no doubt that Ukraine would have the weapons necessary to fight. Reuters reports him reiterating that sanctions inflict damage on Russia, but are not enough alone to stop the war. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has warned at today’s meeting in Brussels that the scale of any impending Russian assault on Donbas will remind the Nato allies of the second world war. “Either you help us now - and I’m speaking about days, not weeks - or your help will come too late, and many people will die,” Reuters reports him telling the media. That statement from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has received a curt reply from the Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak. He dismissed Lavrov’s comments that Kyiv had presented Moscow with a draft peace deal that deviated from proposals both sides had previously agreed on. Podolyak told Reuters in a written statement that Lavrov was not directly involved in negotiations and his statements were “of purely propagandistic significance”. Podolyak said Moscow wanted to divert attention from events in the town of Bucha, where Ukraine accuses Russian troops of killing civilians, and added: “That is how any such statements should be regarded.” It is Martin Belam back here on the blog for now. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia will probably renew its attack on the Ukrainian capital if it succeeds in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Hruzevych, said. Speaking at an online briefing, Hruzevych said: It is likely the enemy has not given up the goal of a second attack on Kyiv – there is such a threat. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, earlier today warned that Russia’s long-term objective is to seize all of Ukraine despite its short-term focus being the east of the country. Russian forces were biding their time as Moscow ramped up intelligence operations there and learned how best to fight Ukrainian troops, she said. Malyar told a video briefing: The key objective of the Russian Federation was and is the capture of the entire territory of Ukraine. Russia planned to do this quickly, but Putin’s blitzkrieg failed. Even so, Russia has not abandoned its plan to take the entire territory of Ukraine. Russia planned to achieve some “smaller objectives” in order to “show results”, she said. But in reality it is using any moment to gather its forces, to regroup its armies, in order to continue its assault. The enemy is learning how to fight us. If in the first days the Russian army was disorientated, then they are now adjusting to our tactics and strategy, and taking time ... in order to learn how to fight our strategy. A Ukrainian negotiator has accused Russian “propagandists” of being “as responsible for atrocities in Ukraine” as Russian troops. Mykhailo Podolyak, a key adviser to President Zelenskiy and a member of Ukraine’s delegation in talks with Russia, said Moscow’s “hostility in media” must be reduced to prove it is ready for dialogue. The mayor of Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, has urged women, children and the elderly to leave because fighting with Russia is expected to intensify in eastern regions, Reuters reports. The mayor, Borys Filatov, said in an online video address: All those who have the ability, as I have already said, should leave. This involves women, children, the elderly, those who are not …. directly integrated into the economy. Dnipro, which usually has a population of almost one million people, has so far been spared the worst of the fighting that has devastated cities further east and south, such as Mariupol. Filatov’s warnings follow similar calls by authorities in the Luhansk region, east of Dnipro. On Wednesday, the regional governor of Luhansk urged all residents to evacuate while they still could in relative safety. Boris Johnson described Russia’s actions in Ukraine as the “systematic slaughter of innocent people” but stopped short of using the word “genocide”, PA Media news agency reports. Johnson said: I think people are looking at what is happening in Ukraine and they can see this is systematic slaughter of innocent people. Whatever term you want to use, it is totally unconscionable, and the world is now overwhelmingly on the side of the Ukrainians. The UK will continue with our friends and partners to do everything we can to help. When asked about reports that the UK would be sending armoured vehicles to the Ukrainian army, he said the government was looking at what further military assistance it could give. Johnson said: We have tougher sanctions coming in today on [Russian state-owned] Sberbank, individuals, and we are certainly looking at what more military assistance we can give. The Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, said his country must be involved in negotiations to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Lukashenko was quoted by the Belarusian state news agency Belta as saying that he expected to hold talks with Vladimir Putin in the next few days. Lukashenko said: There can be no separate agreements behind Belarus’s back. Since you dragged us into this – principally western countries – the position of Belarus naturally needs to be heard at these negotiations. Belarus’s foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, insisted Lukashenko himself “must participate in the (final) meeting”. Lukashenko also claimed Belarus had been unfairly labelled “an accomplice of the aggressor” as a result of western sanctions. Belta quoted Lukashenko as saying: We do not need this war. Because as a result of this conflict between two Slavic peoples, we are the ones who may suffer the most. German intelligence agencies have intercepted radio messages from Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in Ukraine, according to reports. Local news magazine Der Spiegel reported on Thursday that the country’s office had intercepted the radio messages and presented the findings in parliament. Separately, the Washington Post reported Germany’s foreign intelligence service claimed to have intercepted two separate communications, in which Russian soldiers described how they question soldiers as well as civilians, and then proceed to shoot them. The Post cited an intelligence official it said was familiar with the findings. It was not clear in which part of Ukraine the recordings come from. The Kremlin said it was bewildered by the US decision to impose sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s daughters, describing the move as “difficult to understand and explain”, Reuters reports. The US announced fresh sanctions yesterday targeting the Russian leader’s two adult daughters, Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, as well as Russia’s biggest public and private banks. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters today: Of course we consider these sanctions in themselves to be the extension of an absolutely rabid position on the imposition of restrictions. In any case, the ongoing line on imposing restrictions against family members speaks for itself. The Kremlin could not comprehend why Putin’s daughters would be targeted, he claimed. This is something that is difficult to understand and explain. Unfortunately, we have to deal with such opponents. Russian troops used civilians as human shields to try to protect themselves from a counter-attack from Ukrainian forces in a village in northern Ukraine, the BBC reports. Villagers from Obukhovychi, just south of the exclusion zone around the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, said Russian troops were losing soldiers and armoured vehicles to a counter-attack from Ukrainian forces on the night of 14 March. They said Russian troops went door-to-door to round up about 150 people at gunpoint and held them in a freezing cold school gym as protection for Russian forces. Lydmila Sutkova, one of the villagers interviewed by the BBC, told them: They took us from the cellars where we were hiding and forced us out. Old ladies, children, everyone. It was terrifying. They broke open the doors of anyone who wouldn’t open up. Another villager, Maryana, said her daughter was still showing signs of anxiety since the night: A two-year-old girl should not see this. I was afraid that we would all be shot in that gym. I was scared for my daughter. I don’t have the words. When the Russian invasion reached Mariupol in Ukraine at the end of February, Alena Zagreba, 15, went from filming vlogs with her friends to chronicling the destruction of her home city. While most people hid in bunkers and cellars, Alena and her parents stayed above ground, and her videos are a rare insight into the intense attacks by Russian forces. Alena melted snow for water while her parents cooked on makeshift firepits outside. The family survived by moving from house to house as shelling made their home and other shelters uninhabitable. Alena said at one point in the diary that her nerves had been “destroyed” by the constant bombardment. Our Helena Smith watched Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy address the Greek parliament in Athens. Here is her report: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has received rapturous applause addressing the Greek parliament today. The leader went to the heart of the matter by kicking off his speech with mention of Mariupol, the strategically important south-eastern port city that has become a symbol of the suffering Ukraine has suffered at the hands of Russian forces. With over 100,000 ethnic Greeks living there the besieged town has a special place in Greek hearts, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has repeatedly said. “For over a month I have woken up every day thinking of Mariupol,” Zelenskiy told Greek MPs. “What has happened [there] has not happened in European history for more than half a century … Russian soldiers are destroying everything, they have bombed hospitals, maternity wards even the town’s municipal theatre. We have all seen these things, we have all seen what Russian pilots have done. Mariupol has been destroyed. This peaceful town has experienced the violence of Russian troops.” Appealing to Greek sensitivity regarding the presence of a once vibrant diaspora in the Black Sea region, Zelenskiy said there were now fears that the country would lose a large part of its identity “that Greek culture had brought”. “This was the cradle of the Greek community for centuries,” he said before two Ukrainian fighters of Greek heritage also addressed the chamber. Invoking the mantra of battle-hardened Greeks during the war of independence against the Ottoman empire which began in 1821, the Ukrainian leader added: “Your own revolutionaries said ‘freedom or death’ and that today is what we are saying. Beside Mariupol, Odesa, another big centre of Hellenism, is also threatened.” Zelenskiy also referred to the Filiki Etairia, a secret society of friends that was founded in Odesa with the aim of overthrowing Ottoman rule. “The Filiki Etairia was also created here and this is of huge significance,” he told lawmakers. “A Filiki Etairia could [now] be created in Greece [for the purpose of giving] immediate help which Mariupol and Odesa so need … With the practical solidarity of Greece we will be able to emerge victorious.” G7 foreign ministers have condemned “in the strongest terms” the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns. In a joint statement, they said: Haunting images of civilian deaths, victims of torture, and apparent executions, as well as reports of sexual violence and destruction of civilian infrastructure show the true face of Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and its people. The massacres in the town of Bucha and other Ukrainian towns will be inscribed in the list of atrocities and severe violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights, committed by the aggressor on Ukrainian soil. Ministers expressed their “heartfelt solidarity with the Ukrainian people and our deepest condolences to the victims”. We underline our unwavering support for Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders and express our readiness to assist further, including with military equipment and financial means, to allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russia’s aggression and to rebuild Ukraine. Russia should be suspended from the UN human rights council, they added. Ministers “welcome and support” the work to investigate and gather evidence of potential war crimes and crimes against humanity. They urged Russia to “withdraw completely its military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders”. Hello, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. As always, feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster Ukraine’s war effort, including warplanes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato headquarters, where Nato foreign ministers are meeting later today, Kuleba said there were three items on his agenda for when he spoke to the allies and held bilateral meetings: “Weapons, weapons and weapons.” The UN general assembly will vote later today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. Russia’s defence ministry says it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the south-east of the country. Russian air attacks are now focused mainly on areas of eastern Ukraine, and Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the region, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said. There are to be 10 humanitarian corridors open for civilian evacuations across Ukraine today, but Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said residents trying to leave Mariupol would again have to use their own vehicles. The mayor of the besieged city says more than 100,000 people still need urgent evacuation from the city, and that more than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the US supplying Ukraine with weapons “will not contribute to the success of Russian-Ukrainian talks”. Poland’s deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz has said the country needs financial assistance after the arrival of 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees, many of them children, into his country. The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Athens would ask the international court of justice at The Hague to investigate war crimes in the besieged city of Mariupol. Ukraine and Hungary have again exchanged barbed words. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it considered Hungary’s willingness to pay for Russian gas in roubles an “unfriendly act”. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, has confirmed that fuel for Hungary’s nuclear power plants has arrived by air from Russia, and restated that Hungary does not support proposals for European energy sanctions against Russia. Defence ministers from Black Sea coastal countries have held a video call to discuss the war in Ukraine, mines floating in the sea and regional security, the Turkish defence ministry said, adding that the ministers called for an immediate ceasefire. Russia’s communications watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for allegedly violating Russian law. Roskomnadzor accused YouTube of being one of the “key platforms” it claims is spreading fake information about Russia’s conduct in the war. YouTube has suspended the account of Chinese national Wang Jixian in Odesa who has criticised Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, after being reported to the platform for content containing “suspected violence”. The number of alleged Russian war crimes Ukraine says is currently under investigation has increased to 4,820 according to a recent update from Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said her country was imposing sanctions on 67 Russians over the invasion of Ukraine. Austria, meanwhile, is to expel four Russian diplomats. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. I am handing over to Léonie Chao-Fong Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday called on the west to “bring Russia to justice”, saying Moscow’s actions were directed not only against Ukraine but also Europe. “Once and for all, we can teach Russia and any other potential aggressors that those who choose war always lose ... those who blackmail Europe with economic and energy crisis always lose,” Zelenskiy said in an address to Greek lawmakers in Athens, speaking through an interpreter. Reuters reports that he reiterated calls that the democratic world reject Russian oil and completely block Russian banks from the international finance system. “Let us be honest, since the very beginning Russia’s actions were directed not only against Ukraine but also Europe,” he said. He accused Russia of doing all it could economically to provoke inflation across the continent. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us over the newswires from Hostomel and Borodyanka in Ukraine. The mayor of Mariupol says over 100,000 people still need urgent evacuation from the city, Reuters reports. There are set to be ten humanitarian corridors open for civilian evacuations across Ukraine today, but earlier Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said residents trying to leave Mariupol will again have to use their own vehicles. “Pumping weapons into Ukraine will not contribute to the success of Russian-Ukrainian talks,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters when asked about US weapons supplies to Ukraine. “Of course this will most likely have a negative effect.” Reuters also reports these key lines from Peskov’s regular briefing: Peskov said sanctions being applied by the US on Putin’s family speak for themselves, and that it is hard to understand or explain the move He said Putin has yet to decide whether to attend the next G20 summit – which is due in Indonesia in November – and a decision will be taken according to how events unfold. Also on the energy side of things, Finland has said it will invest up to €850m (£700m) to ensure sufficient energy supply and to speed up breaking away from its dependence on Russian energy. Reuters reports the country will also acquire a new floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal together with Estonia to be placed in Finland to put an end to gas deliveries from Russia, minister of economic affairs Mika Lintila said The oil company Shell has confirmed it will take a hit of between $4bn and $5bn (£3.1bn and £3.8bn) from offloading its Russian assets as the firm pulls back from the country. Bosses said they will no longer buy oil on the spot market but will continue to fulfil contracts on buying fuel from Russia signed before the invasion of Ukraine. PA Media quotes the company saying: “Shell has not renewed longer-term contracts for Russian oil, and will only do so under explicit government direction, but we are legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion.” The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, says Athens will ask the international court of justice at The Hague to investigate war crimes in the besieged city of Mariupol. “Greece will request that the international court of justice investigate war crimes that have occurred in Mariupol,” he said in comments made before attending today’s meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. “Greece has a particular interest in Mariupol because of the Greek community of more than 100,000 people there. In addition I will ask my counterparts in the alliance to do the best that they can to [not only] help Ukraine but to protect Odesa, so that Odesa does not suffer the same fate as Mariupol.” Dendias, who led a humanitarian aid mission to the southern port city at the weekend, made the comments before Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addresses Athens’ 300-seat parliament today. During his trip to Odesa on Sunday, the Greek foreign minister also announced the reopening of Greece’s consulate there to help ethnic Greeks flee areas in the south-east that are now the focus of Russia’s military offensive. “The reopening of [Greece’s] consulate will help distribute humanitarian aid and set up corridors for the Greek ethnic community to leave from any areas of Ukraine, if needed, via Odesa,” he said. Russian air attacks are now focused mainly on areas of eastern Ukraine, and Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the region, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said. He said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain. “The situation is under control,” he said on national television, Reuters reports. Russia’s communications watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for allegedly violating Russian law. Reuters reports that the Roskomnadzor watchdog accused YouTube, which has blocked Russian state-funded media globally from using its platform, of becoming “one of the key platforms spreading fakes about the course of special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation”. Russia has continued to officially describe its attack on Ukraine as a “special military operation”, and has made varying claims that images of atrocities that have emerged from Bucha and elsewhere in the country are a staged “provocation”. Ukraine’s foreign minister has called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster the country’s war effort, including war planes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato’s headquarters, where foreign ministers are due to meet today, Dmytro Kuleba said there were three items on his agenda: “Weapons, weapons and weapons”. Here is the video clip: The UK’s Ministry of Defence have issued their latest assessment of the situation in the ground in Ukraine. They say: Progressing offensive operations in eastern Ukraine is the main focus of Russian military forces. Russian artillery and air strikes continue along the Donbas line of control. Russian strikes against infrastructure targets within the Ukrainian interior are likely intended to degrade the ability of the Ukrainian military to resupply and increase pressure on the Ukrainian government. Despite refocussing forces and logistics capabilities to support operations in the Donbas, Russian forces are likely to continue facing morale issues and shortages of supplies and personnel. Earlier the Russian defence ministry says it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv, which are all towards the east of Ukraine and the Donbas area. [see 8.32am] Poland’s deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz has been on the media in the UK this morning, telling the BBC Today programme that the country needs financial assistance over the volume of Ukrainian refugees now in Poland. PA Media quotes him saying: They could offer a bit more financial support, you know, those 2.5 million people need accommodation. Half of them basically are kids, which we are successfully integrating to the Polish schooling system. But it also brings some costs. Suddenly, in a couple of weeks, we are 2.5 million bigger. So any kind of financial assistance would be very much welcome. Przydacz also said that he opposed countries having quotas on accepting refugees: These are our neighbours. Ukrainian friends are very much welcome to stay in Poland. People are free people. If they want to go to the Great Britain and the Great Britain is ready to host them - we have absolutely nothing against them. But we are strongly opposing the policy of quotas or forcing people to live in a country. Tension between Ukraine and Hungary has not eased this morning, with Reuters carrying quotes from two simultaneous briefings. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has this morning said that it considers Hungary’s willingness to pay for Russian gas in roubles an “unfriendly act”. Ukraine also said that Hungary’s stance over the allegations of Russian atrocities strengthens Russia’s sense of impunity and encourages Russia “to commit new atrocities against Ukrainians.” Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said “If Hungary really wants to help end the war, here’s how to do it: stop destroying unity in the EU, support new anti-Russian sanctions, provide military assistance to Ukraine, and not create additional sources of funding for Russia’s military machine. It is never too late to get on the right side of history,” For their part, Hungary’s foreign minister Péter Szijjártó has confirmed that fuel for Hungary’s nuclear power plants has arrived by air from Russia. The Russian attack on Ukraine has made shipments by rail impossible. He has restated that Hungary does not support proposals for European energy sanctions against Russia. He added that imposing any sanctions on activities related to nuclear energy would also be a “red line” for Hungary. There has been an increasing tension between Hungary and Ukraine in the last few days. Viktor Orbán described Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as one of the enemies he “over-powered” with his election victory at the weekend. For his part, Zelenskiy said Orbán was frightened of Moscow and needed to choose between Russia and the “other world”. The two countries share about 135 km (85 miles) of border, roughly following the Tisza river to the west of Ukraine. Defence ministers from Black Sea coastal countries have held a video call to discuss the war in Ukraine, mines floating in the sea and regional security, the Turkish Defence Ministry said, adding the ministers called for an immediate ceasefire. Reuters reports from Ankara that in a statement, Turkey said the defence ministers of Bulgaria, Georgia, Poland, Romania and Ukraine had met via video conference upon the invitation of Turkey, adding they held “very efficient” talks. “Aside from the mines, the importance of cooperation in the Black Sea for peace, calm and stability was emphasised,” Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar, who participated in the call, said after the meeting. According to his ministry, the ministers discussed possible steps to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and get aid to Ukraine. Turkish military diving teams have so far detonated three separate floating naval mines in the Black Sea, while Romania has also defused a stray mine in its waters since the Ukraine war. A quick Reuters snap here that Russia’s defence ministry says it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the southeast of the country. There is as yet no independent verification of this claim. Yesterday the Ukrainian State Emergency Service released images of firefighters working to extinguish flames at a fuel storage depot that had been struck in the Dnipropetrovsk region. A quick quote from UK foreign secretary Liz Truss in Brussels here, after she briefly spoke to the media ahead of today’s round of meetings. She said in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine: “the G7 and Nato is stepping up our efforts on sanctions and on weapons. The UK is now banning all imports of Russian energy. We’re sanctioning more banks, and we’re stepping up our supply of weapons to Ukraine.” Mark Voyger is an expert on eastern Europe and Russia – he is a non-resident senior fellow with the Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Center for European Analysis – and he has been interviewed on Sky News in the UK, and made two particularly interesting points. Speaking from Warsaw, on the issue of the Black Sea, he was in favour of Nato patrolling it to deter Russian military activity. He said: The Black Sea is now being turned into a Russian lake just like the Azov Sea was, and the Black Sea actually is shared by multiple Nato members: Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey. So I would say ultimately we need to do that. If there is no no-fly zone, if we feel reluctant to impose it, we can do something about a no-sail zone, if you will, in the Black Sea, because Russia has been targeting international navigation. He was asked who was winning the war, and he had this to say: Ukraine is winning it on the ground, tactically, operationally, internationally, strategically. I will say information-wise, the information warfare is definitely critical. Unfortunately, you know, Putin is still in power and he’s winning the war at home. He is slowly but surely recreating the Soviet system – a totalitarian system that bans all dissent and stifles access to free information. So internationally, Ukraine is winning. Domestically, Russia is winning, until such time that we’re able to penetrate through this thick wall of lies and propaganda and convince the Russian people that he’s bad even for Russian. Foreign minister Marise Payne said this that Australia was imposing sanctions on 67 Russians over the invasion of Ukraine. “Today, I’m announcing 67 further sanctions of Russian elites and oligarchs, those close to Putin who facilitate and support his outrageous actions,” Reuters reports she told reporters as she arrived at Nato. Australia is not a member of Nato, but like Japan, is present at today’s meeting as a guest. Austria is the latest European country to announce diplomatic sanctions against Russia. This morning the foreign ministry there has announced that it is expelling three Russian diplomat from the embassy in Vienna, and one from the consulate in Salzburg. Reuters reports that a foreign ministry spokesperson said the Russian officials had behaved in a way that was incompatible with their diplomatic status. They must leave the country by 12 April. There has been a wave of expulsions of Russian diplomatic staff – although some countries, notably Britain, Canada and Australia, have yet to take any action. Here’s the video clip of Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying that Russia will regard weak sanctions as “permission to attack”. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has posted some pictures of him in his Nato meetings in Brussels, and has repeated his “three things” line: Met with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at Nato HQ in Brussels. I came here today to discuss three most important things: weapons, weapons, and weapons. Ukraine’s urgent needs, the sustainability of supplies, and long-term solutions which will help Ukraine to prevail. Yesterday EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the EU has given €35bn to Russia in energy payments since the start of the war, compared to €1bn given to Ukraine in arms and weapons. There’s no sign of that changing any time soon. Russian state-owned gas producer Gazprom said today it continued to supply natural gas to Europe via Ukraine on Thursday in line with requests from European consumers. Requests stood at 105.4 million cubic metres for 7 April, slightly down on the day before. Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, has announced that Ukraine is aiming to open ten humanitarian corridors on Thursday. Residents trying to leave the besieged city of Mariupol will again have to use their own vehicles. Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs has just published some images of people being evacuated within the country. They say: The State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Donetsk region evacuated 198 people on April 6, 45 of them children. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has just tweeted out a response to developments in the US. He said: Grateful to the US Senate for passing the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act. Important first step towards a lend-lease program to expedite the delivery of military equipment to Ukraine. Looking forward to its swift passage in the House and signing by the US President. This is Martin Belam here in London taking over the blog from Samantha Lock. You can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The number of alleged Russian war crimes Ukraine says is currently under investigation has increased to 4,820 according to a recent update from Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office. It is also believed that 167 children have been killed in Ukraine as result of Russia’s invasion. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster Ukraine’s war effort, including war planes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato headquarters, where Nato foreign ministers are meeting later today, Kuleba said there are three items on his agenda when he talks to the allies and holds bilateral meetings: “Weapons, weapons and weapons”. The Ukrainian foreign minister said there is no distinction between offensive and defensive weapons - any weapons, including tanks and fast jets, would be used to defend Ukraine. He added that any country making this distinction are being hypocritical. The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.” Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr. Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine. He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state. And he’s really only taken control of a small number of population centres. And even they weren’t the ones that he was really going after. So, you know, Mariupol is still not taken. He’s moved his forces out of Kyiv. He’s moved his forces out of Cherniniv. They haven’t taken Kharkiv. They haven’t taken Mykolayiv in the south. So, I think the proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing every day. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting for their country. And they have denied Mr. Putin so many of his strategic objectives. So absolutely, they can win.” Russia is focusing on an impending offensive operation in eastern Ukraine with the aim to take control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukraine’s ministry of defence has said, corroborating western intelligence report. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said some withdrawn Russian units are now located in “tent camps” in a number of regions bordering Ukraine. “The Russian servicemen refuse to take part in further hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. The moral and psychological condition of these personnel is low and tends to deteriorate,” an operational report published this morning reads. Russia “continues to look for ways to solve the problem of replenishing its units with human resources” and has “stepped up work with conscripts who have been discharged from military service since 2012” officials added. The Russian occupiers continue to use violence against civilians in the temporarily occupied territories and are forcible deporting residents of Mariupol to the temporarily occupied districts of Donetsk, the report claimed. More than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the city’s mayor has said. Vadym Boichenko noted that Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death. Boichenko also said that more than 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed due to Russian bombardments. The Russian military has besieged the port city, cutting off access to food, water and energy supplies while continually dropping artillery and air raids on the town. On Wednesday, about 1,000 people were able to make it out of the besieged port city in a convoy of buses and private cars organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They are now at the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia. The ICRC team had tried for five days and four nights to reach Mariupol, coming within 12 miles of the city, but security conditions made it impossible to enter. Ukrainian officials said the Russian military had pounded the city over the past 24 hours, with 118 airstrikes. They also said Russian soldiers were gathering bodies in order to destroy evidence of war crimes. A mobile crematorium was going from street to street, collecting and disposing of corpses from people killed by shelling and shooting. In its latest assessment, the UK’s ministry of defence said the humanitarian situation in Mariupol was deteriorating. “More than 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender,” it said. Russia is blocking humanitarian access to the besieged port city of Mariupol because it wants to hide evidence of “thousands” of people killed there, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. In an interview with Turkey’s Haberturk TV, he said: I think Russia is afraid that [if] we successfully send humanitarian aid to Mariupol, then the whole world will see what’s going on here. Russia doesn’t want anything to be seen until they take control of the city until they clean it all up. Mariupol is hell right now. Thousands have either been killed or injured. The number of those killed and injured is increasing day by day ... we do not have clear information on the number of those who lost their lives. They are trying to cover up the situation. In this case, they are trying to prevent the humanitarian supply. They will not be able to cover up everything. They will not be able to bury or hide thousands of people. The world has seen the real situation. It has seen what has been done to a Ukrainian city.” Zelenskiy said that Russia had already attempted to conceal evidence of crimes in the town of Bucha outside of Kyiv and several nearby communities, where Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of carrying out widespread killings of civilians. “They burned families. Families. Yesterday we found again a new family: father, mother, two children. Little, little children, two. One was a little hand, you know,” Zelensky said. “That’s why I said ‘they are Nazis’.” Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, urged civilians to leave the east of the country “while the opportunity still exists” before a massive Russian military assault that it expects in the coming days. Vereshchuk said authorities would “not be able to help” residents who stayed behind once large-scale fighting erupted. She said the governors of the Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions were calling on people to move immediately to safer areas. “It has to be done now, because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it,” she posted on Telegram. The Kremlin has said it intends to seize the entire Donetsk region, amid reports that Putin is keen to declare victory in Ukraine in time for 9 May, the annual commemoration of the Soviet defeat of Hitler in the second world war. In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that the Russian military continued to build up its forces in preparation for a new offensive in the east, where the Kremlin has said its goal is to “liberate” the Donbas. YouTube has suspended the account of a Chinese national in Odessa who has criticised Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine after being reported to the platform for content containing “suspected violence”, the Guardian’s Rhoda Kwan reports from Taipei. Wang Jixian, whose daily Mandarin vlogs detailing his life in the Ukrainian city made him an internet sensation, was temporarily suspended on Thursday last week. In his video immediately before the suspension, his video showed Chinese translations of a voice recording of Ukrainians speaking about atrocities committed by Russian soldiers. The Beijing native began posting daily vlogs on his YouTube channel shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. “Today is … I am still in Odesa. I am still alive,” his videos begin. His daily updates quickly drew more than 100,000 followers but also the ire of China’s legions of nationalistic netizens. His channel suddenly went quiet last week. Read the full story below. Zelenskiy described Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously. Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros to Russia from the oil trade, so as not to jeopardise their own economies... The embargo on Russian oil supplies will be applied anyway. The format will be found. The only question is how many more Ukrainian men and women the Russian military will have time to kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, can borrow a little determination somewhere.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine will also continue to insist on a complete blockade of the Russian banking system from international finance. Here are some of the latest images to come from Ukraine today. In Bucha, two young girls walks hand-in-hand past destroyed Russian military machinery littering the main town street. A child’s teddy bear hangs from a tree in front of a building bombed by the Russian army in Borodyanka while a damaged playground is seen next to a heavily damaged apartment building in Hostomel. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. New investments in Russia are blocked, restrictions are applied against several systemic banks in Russia, personal sanctions are added, as well as other restrictions. This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough.” In his signature nightly national address the Ukrainian president added: If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons we really need and have applied for many times, it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to go further. A permission to attack. A permission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas.” However, Zelenskiy remained optimistic saying “it is still possible to prevent this”. It is still possible to impose such sanctions, which Ukraine insists on, our people insist on. It is still possible to give us weapons that will really stop this aggression. The west can do it. Just as it could have applied preventive sanctions last year to prevent this invasion. If the mistake is made again, if there is no preventive action again, it will be a historic mistake for the whole western world.” Nato foreign ministers will meet in Brussels today to address Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”, the alliance said. Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine. We now see a significant movement of troops away from Kyiv, to regroup, re-arm and resupply, and they shift their focus to the east,” Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said ahead of the meeting. Targeting and murdering civilians is a war crime. All the facts must be established and all those responsible for these atrocities must be brought to justice,” Stoltenberg added, commenting on the horrific images of murdered civilians in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities. Ministers will arrive for talks from 3:30pm local time (2:30pm GMT) and will be joined by their counterparts from Ukraine, Finland, Sweden, Georgia, and the European Union, and by Nato’s Asia-Pacific partners - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. “At a time when authoritarian powers are pushing back on the rules-based international order, it is even more important for democracies to stand together, and protect our values,” Stoltenberg said in a statement published by Nato. Allies are stepping up their support for Ukraine’s right to defend itself, including with anti-tank weapons, air-defence systems and other equipment, as well as increased humanitarian assistance and financial aid.” Allied foreign ministers will also discuss the development of Nato’s next strategic concept, to guide the Alliance’s adaptation to the new global security reality. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. In his daily address on Thursday, he called for the democratic world to reject Russian oil and completely block Russian banks from the international finance system. Zelenskiy said the west’s hesitation to agree on an oil embargo is costing Ukrainian lives. Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously, he added. The US, UK and EU unveiled new sanctions against Moscow. US sanctions target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia as well as sanctions on Putin’s adult daughters. The UK will impose an asset freeze on Russia’s largest bank, place sanctions on eight more oligarchs and end imports of oil and coal by next year, foreign secretary Liz Truss said. The EU announced a wide-ranging package of sanctions, including import bans on coal and transaction bans on banks. Nato’s foreign ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday for two days of talks on bringing an end to the war. The UN General Assembly will vote today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Hungary’s right-wing, Putin-allied prime minister Viktor Orbán gave a press conference in which he said he had offered to broker talks with Russia. He offered to work towards a ceasefire, while stopping short of agreeing to extend EU sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas shipments. Zelenskiy said Kremlin forces were trying to cover up evidence of atrocities. “We have information that the Russian military has changed its tactics and is trying to remove people who have been killed from streets and basements ... this is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more,” he said Thursday, but did not provide evidence. US prosecutors are working with their European and Ukrainian counterparts to help collect evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Russia’s military has now shifted its focus to the east of the Ukraine, with Ukraine authorities in Luhansk and Donetsk warning that civilians should leave “while the opportunity still exists” before a massive Russian military assault that it expects in the coming days. It comes as western officials say Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could go to Donbas and perhaps longer. Russia is hiding ‘thousands’ killed in Mariupol, Zelenskiy said. Russian forces are blocking humanitarian access to the besieged port city of Mariupol because it wants to hide evidence of “thousands” of people killed there, the president said. More than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since the start of Russia’s invasion, the mayor of the besieged city said. Vadym Boichenko said 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed and Russian forces have targeted a hospital where 50 people were burned to death. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to access the city, about 1,000 people made it out of Mariupol in a convoy of buses and private cars organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They are now at the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia. A total of 4,892 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities on Wednesday using humanitarian corridors, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, compared with 3,846 who were evacuated on Tuesday. Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the US to operate deadly Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Defence department spokesman John Kirby said it was a “very small” number of Ukrainian troops who were already in the US before Russia invaded their country. Britain is drawing up plans to send armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to The Times. Options include sending a protected patrol vehicle, such as the Mastiff, or a vehicle like the Jackal, which can be used as a reconnaissance or long-range patrol vehicle, a ministry of defence report said. Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a “good understanding” of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, US deputy secretary of state said. The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.”"
"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",2022-04-07T22:01:04Z,Nicola Davis Science correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p8d,"People who have the Omicron Covid variant tend to have symptoms for a shorter period, a lower risk of being admitted to hospital and a different set of symptoms from those who have Delta, research has suggested. As the highly transmissible Omicron variant shot to dominance towards the end of last year, it emerged that, while it is better at dodging the body’s immune responses than Delta, it also produces less severe disease. Now a large study has not only backed up the findings, but confirmed reports Omicron is linked to a shorter duration of illness and a different collection of symptoms. The study comes just days after the NHS added nine further symptoms for Covid to its existing list of fever, a new and persistent cough, and a loss or change in taste or smell. The researchers found people who had Covid when Omicron was prevalent were about half as likely to report having at least one of the latter three symptoms as those who had Covid when Delta was rife. “It is a lesson that we need to be far more flexible in thinking what the virus is and how it is going to present than we have been, certainly in the UK,” said Prof Tim Spector, co-author of the research from King’s College London, adding that the team showed data to the government around five months ago that showed a sore throat was replacing loss of smell as a symptom. The study, which is to be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases and has been published in the Lancet, is based on data from 63,002 participants of the Zoe Covid study. The researchers matched almost 4,990 participants who had a confirmed Covid infection between 1 June and 27 November 2021 – when Delta was the most prevalent variant – with 4,990 individuals who reported an infection between 20 December 2021 and 17 January 2022 when Omicron dominated, with the matching based on age, sex and whether they had received two or three vaccine doses. The experience of both groups were then compared. The team found participants’ symptoms lasted on average 6.9 days during the period when Omicron dominated, compared with 8.9 days when Delta dominated, with infections during the Omicron period linked to a 25% lower likelihood of admission to hospital. The results suggested only 17% of people who had Covid when Omicron dominated lost their sense of smell, compared with 53% when Delta dominated. However, a sore throat and going hoarse were both more common among the former. Spector said the symptom-logging approach used in the research was an invaluable tool. “[It] should alert us what to look out for when there will inevitably be the next variant,” he said, adding action needs to be quicker in the future. “We need to be much more reactive in public health messaging,” he said. Dr David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School, who was not involved in the study, said the findings chime with what hospitals experienced at the start of the year when the BA.1 Omicron variant dominated. But the Omicron variant BA.2 has since taken over – and, in his experience, the picture has changed again. “People in hospital are staying in hospital for longer and staff are testing positive for longer, so it is longer before they can return to work,” he said. The research came as the React-1 study revealed the average prevalence of Covid across England was at the highest level ever recorded. Meanwhile, the UK Health Security Agency reported on Thursday that 15.3% of people aged 75 and over have received their spring booster Covid jab so far."
"West Ham 1-1 Lyon: Europa League quarter-final, first leg – live reaction!",2022-04-07T18:00:09Z,Tim de Lisle,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zac,"Jarrod Bowen, the main man for West Ham, is talking to BT. What did he think about the red card? “Thought it was cheap if I’m honest, he [Dembele] was going away from goal. Only seen it live though, haven’t watched it back.” What was Moyes’ message at half-time? “Keep your heads, stay in the game.” Bowen adds: “We weren’t at our best tonight, but we’re still confident.” The Guardian’s match report is in from Jacob Steinberg at the London Stadium, so that’s my cue to say goodnight. Thanks for your company, correspondence and erudite references to the Rolling Stones, J-M Jarre and Smash Hits. All the Europa League quarter-finals (first legs) took place in binary. Three of them ended 1-1, including Barcelona’s game in Frankfurt, but there was one result – poor old Rangers lost 1-0 at Sporting Braga. “There was more diving in this match,” says Nora Mulcahy, “than I have seen in a swimming pool!” It was a curious match. Nothing happened for 47 minutes, then everything happened in one moment when an inexperienced ref gave Aaron Cresswell a straight red for a minor offence. The ten men of West Ham responded magnificently to take the lead, blew it by conceding a soft goal, but then rallied to see out the draw. They live to fight another night. David Moyes allows himself a smile before he sets about thanking the crowd with his usual courtesy. His team have shown a lot of character. All over! And West Ham have a draw that feels like a win. 90+8 min: Two more shots from Lyon – one saved by Areola, the other blocked. 90+7 min: A through ball finds Dembele – but Dawson finds an old-school tackle, which the crowd greet as if it was a goal. 90+6 min: A yellow for Bowen, for giving Emerson a shove as the ball (and both of them) went out. 90+5 min: One of those crosses does elude the West Ham centre-backs, but Dembele can’t keep his header down. 90+4 min: David Moyes has had so much to think about in this half, he hasn’t used any more subs. 90+3 min: Lyon are now putting their crosses in the air, which is a surprise as Dawson and Zouma have had aerial supremacy throughout. 90 min: There will be EIGHT added minutes. 88 min: Antonio goes in too hard on Ndombele, studs up, and rightly gets a yellow. That’s a worse foul than the one Cresswell was sent off for. 85 min: West Ham storm forward again, with Antonio and Bowen doing the job of three men – whereupon some idiot runs onto the pitch. 83 min: When they do get out, West Ham are piling players forward, which is brave but risky. Maybe they’re betting on Lyon continuing to be slow in their build-up. 80 min: Another save from Areola, more confident this time, as Emerson shoots hard and low. I make it 3-3 for shots on target; for shots taken, it’s now 17-5 to Lyon. 78 min: Paqueta has a shot, straight at Areola, but hit so hard that the keeper parries it. This is becoming a siege. An email from the ground! “Half-time greetings from the London stadium,” said Ian Sargeant, a little while ago. “As a gent in his early 50s, I was a mere spotty youth when I first came across your name every other Thursday in the pages of Smash Hits. That red card has hit me like the news that Yazoo were breaking up. Keep up the good work.” Ha, thanks Ian. Those were the days. 73 min: Lyon are knocking it around again. They squeeze a through ball in to Demebele, but he’s offside. “If Iron Maiden are the go-to musicians for West Ham,” says Kári Tulinius, “who’d be the in the same role for Lyon? The first one to spring to mind is Jean-Michel Jarre, who’s certainly the most successful musician from that lovely city.” 69 min: Antonio is back up top, giving his all as ever, but Lyon have fresh legs on both flanks. As well as Tete, Toko-Ekambi has come on. The men taken off are Faivre and Boateng. What this means for Lyon’s formation, I’m not sure. Nooo! Just when they were playing so well, West Ham allow Tete, just on as a sub, to wriggle into the box and cross. Fredericks gets in the way of it, but can only give Ndombele a tap-in. 64 min: “West Ham looking more of a threat with ten than they did with 11,” says the commentator, and he’s not wrong. 62 min: Antonio has moved to the right wing, once his natural habitat. Bowen is leading the line, as well he may after scoring his 14th goal of the season. Bowen duly gets away down the left and does well to cross for Antonio, who either misses the ball or pulls out of his shot as he bears down on the keeper. 60 min: Play stops for the right reason as Fredericks needs some attention after a clash of heads with Dembele. He seems OK, happily. 57 min: Yet another long-range shot from Lyon – better than most, as Ndombele lashes a drive past the post. 55 min: Credit too to Pablo Fornals, who did well to half-force the error from Boateng by pressing high and hard. 53 min: It was a mistake by Boateng, who allowed the ball to bobble through to Bowen. He would have been offside but was saved by Boateng’s touch. And the finish was nice and calm, into the corner. The crowd, who had been feeling very sorry for themselves, have come alive again. What the hell! 46 min: West Ham were already playing a low block, so not much has changed as yet. But their problem is that when they hoof it long to Antonio, he now has nobody to flick it on to. West Ham are out early for the second half. Ben Johnson has come on to replace Cresswell, and Benrahma has been sacrificed, which is a shame as he was playing well. The wink has already been shown about six times. And rightly so in my humble opinion, because the incident did seem to be part of a pattern. Several times, a Lyon player had gone down softly, or stayed down implausibly. And the ref had let them get away with it. “I want West Ham to win,” says Adam Berry, “but I don’t see the controversy around that sending off. Cresswell has got his eyes on the man, Dembele has the run on him, Cresswell clearly tugs his shoulder, and if it happened in the middle of the pitch it’d be a clear foul and yellow. It’s the right call in my opinion. “The wink was equally parts infuriating and hilarious though.” “I’ve got to say,” says Nick Jones, “if that was a straight red, I’m a banana. Watching this on holiday in Mallorca, with a lot of unhappy WHU fans. Quite mad.” Are there any Lyon fans in the house? They might well agree with you. On a happier note, here’s Joe Pearson in Indianapolis. “I thought,” he says, “it was THE LAW that all musical references in West Ham MBMs must be Iron Maiden related. Or maybe we’ve just entered a brave new world.” You wait 45 minutes for something to happen, and then it’s a shocker. As Cresswell got his straight red, a camera zoomed in on Moussa Dembele – who was winking. This match may have been ruined before it has even got going. 45+5 min: Lyon waste the free kick, but pick up a corner. It’s been a long two minutes. This is highly controversial. Dembele was away, Cresswell did get a touch with his hand, but the red card seems very harsh. 45+1 min: We’re into the first of two added minutes. 45 min: West Ham spend a minute in Lyon’s half, for once, and get their reward as Bowen wins a free kick on the right wing. Lyon clear it easily enough. 41 min: Declan Rice makes a mistake! He aims a back header, down into the ground, and doesn’t get enough on it, allowing Lyon to take another of their long shots – which brings only a corner. West Ham break with Benrahma down the left. He thinks he’s won a corner too, but the ref gives a goal kick. 39 min: Lyon go back to the patient build-up, which seems to be their default. West Ham escape with the long ball. Emerson and Fredericks go for a 50-50 and end up nose to nose. The words “Fuck you” may have been uttered (by Emerson). “I hope you’re well!” says Adam Kline-Schoder. Can’t complain. “I am watching the Eintracht Frankfurt-Barcelona match -- since you didn’t ask: 0-0 but Piqué is off injured already and Frankfurt should really be 2-0 up -- and am keeping tabs on the West Ham-Lyon game through your MBM. I saw the photo at the top of the page, and it got me thinking: why do teams change their kits for European competition? West Ham’s shorts are usually white at home but here are claret (I believe Leicester do the same with blue), and Manchester City have their weird digital numbers on their Champions League kits. Is that unique to British teams? Is it sponsorship nonsense? Enquiring minds (read: my mind) want to know.” I’m not sure! So I’m throwing it out to the floor. 36 min: There’s a delay as Jerome Boating gets some treatment for what looks like cramp, odd as it may sound. 32 min: We have another shot on target! From Declan Rice, not tumbling but taking part in a training-ground corner routine. He has to take it with his left foot, and it’s the opposite of that shot from Ndombele: precision without power. West Ham then win another corner, only to do nothing with it. 30 min: A third of the game has somehow slipped by. Lyon have had twice as much of the ball as West Ham, but have also conceded the only shot on target. An email! From Peter Oh. “I suppose West Ham and Rolling Stones fans reckon that it’s only the Europa League, but they like it.” Ha. “Now that you’ve mentioned the Stones having played this ground, I’ll be keeping a close eye on Declan Rice whenever he approaches the Lyon box. If he goes down too easy, I’ll be forced to make a Tumbling Rice joke. In any event, it’s nice to see the visitors play with Gusto.” 28 min: A free kick to West Ham, chipped into the box, but it leads only to a free kick for Lyon as Gusto goes down. 26 min: Lyon go back to knocking it around. Eventually Ndombele gets bored and has a crack from 25 yards – all power and no precision. 23 min: Suddenly it’s end to end as Lyon answer another long ball from West Ham with one of their own. As usual, nothing comes of it bar a feeble appeal for a penalty as Fredericks stops Auouar in his tracks. 20 min: Dembele runs onto a through ball, and he’s probably onside, but Areola is alert to the danger and gets a booming clearance in. 18 min: Lyon have a promising attack, but it ends with West Ham coming close. Rice, clearing up after a poor cross, picks out Antonio, who flicks on, then gets the ball back in the inside-right channel. Again, though, the angle is too tight. 16 min: West Ham come alive! It’s another long ball, but a pinpoint one, from Dawson. Benrahma controls it on the run and gets a firm shot away, but the angle is too tight. 14 min: The game has developed a pattern: patience and latticework passing from Lyon, long balls and high pressing from West Ham, cutting edge from neither. 9 min: A shot! From a Lyon player – about 30 yards out, instantly blocked. But they are warming up, and they play their first threatening cross, whipped in from the left, well defended by West Ham. 8 min: You know how some matches set off at a thunderous pace? This is not one of them. 7 min: Lyon make it into the box, with Dembele holding the ball up well, Lukaku-style, but again the final ball is poor. 5 min: Gusto, Lyon’s pacey right-winger, has plenty of time to get a cross in, but he overcooks it. 3 min: Lyon are being leisurely, West Ham more direct. Antonio gets his head on a punt from Areola but can’t quite find Bowen with his flick-on. 1 min: Lyon get the party started with some neat little passes. Declan Rice bumps fists with the Lyon captain – Moussa Dembele. Rice needs to avoid a yellow if he wants to play in the second leg. West Ham have won their last four at home in all competitions, their best such sequence for ten years. But then Lyon have won their last six away matches in the Europa League. Something’s gotta give. The crowd are absolutely loving it. The London Stadium is rocking as it hasn’t rocked since the Rolling Stones played there a few years ago. Bubbles are being blown. And sung. David Moyes is talking to BT, sounding calm. “Slightly different game,” he says, “It’s the first leg. We’d like to win, but it’s not settled tonight.” He says he picked Ryan Fredericks (over Ben Johnson) partly because of the pace of Karl Toko-Ekambi – who, as he doesn’t add, is on the bench. Lyon (4-2-3-1?): Lopes; Gusto, Boateng, Lukeba, Emerson; Mendes, Ndombele; Faivre, Paqueta, Aouar; Dembele. Subs: Pollersbeck, Da Silva, Denayer, Barcola, Henrique, Dubois, Reine-Adelaide, Barcola, Kadewere, Tete, Toko-Ekambi. West Ham United (4-2-3-1): Areola; Fredericks, Dawson, Zouma, Cresswell; Soucek, Rice; Bowen, Benrahma, Fornals; Antonio. Subs: Fabianski, Johnson, Coufal, Masuaku, Diop, Alese, Noble, Kral, Perkins, Randolph, Vlasic, Yarmolenko. Evening everyone and welcome to West Ham’s biggest European game since ... well, I make it 1981. That one didn’t go too well: after storming into the quarter-finals of the Cup-Winners’ Cup, they went and lost 4-1 at home to Dinamo Tbilisi. But that was then, so long ago that one of their regulars was Frank Lampard (Senior). And this is now, when they’ve just seen off Sevilla, who pretty much own the Europa League. Manchester United, eat your heart out. David Moyes is not only looking down on United in the league table: he’s still in Europe and they’re not. But he won’t be allowing himself much of a gloat because his team face a tricky assignment here. At 538.com, Nate Silver’s prediction machine, West Ham are favoured to make it through this round, but only by 55 per cent to 45. Lyon waltzed through their group, winning five games and losing none. Last time they came to the UK, in September, they beat the mighty Rangers. They’re erratic in Ligue 1, where they lie ninth, but efficient in the Europa: in the last round, against Porto, they won 1-0 away before drawing 1-1 at home. It could be the loudest night at the London Stadium since the win over Sevilla. Kick-off is at 8pm, so I’ll be back soon after 7 with the teams."
Last year I accidentally moved to New Zealand. This can be blamed on love,2022-04-07T21:29:27Z,Rebecca Shaw,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7t73,"I like to think of myself as an easy-breezy kind of gal. One of those people who impulsively follows the faintest whiff of a fun idea, like a cartoon dog floating along the scent of a pie to where it is cooling on a windowsill. But if I’m honest with myself (and you), I have to admit I am not really that person. I am someone who makes plans. I confirm numbers, I find and book restaurants, I get tickets to things in advance and I arrive embarrassingly early everywhere I go. This is why it was so surprising when last year, without planning on it at all, I accidentally moved to New Zealand. This, like most stories of slightly unhinged behaviour, can be blamed on love. During the first lockdown in 2020, when all of our lives had been tipped upside down, I started chatting with a mutual Twitter friend in Aotearoa. Even though we were living through a pandemic, and didn’t know if and when we would ever get to see each other in person, we accidentally fell extremely in love. We went through a stressful and difficult time throughout that year, but after nine months of waiting, she visited me twice for a total of about three weeks. Shortly after her second visit, things began to change again. The border between our countries was still open, but case numbers in Sydney were beginning to rise, and things looked as if they might become dicey. In a rush of heat to my little gay brain, I decided that I should surprise her with a visit as soon as possible. I wanted to spring it on her because it would be fun, but also partially so that she could be spared the stress and worry of waiting, and hoping. She would skip all of the hard stuff we’d just endured, and simply open the door one day, and I would be there. And that’s what happened. It soon became clear that I had made it in by the skin of my teeth (a disgusting idiom). It seems almost quaint now, but the plane that arrived directly after mine became big news, carrying a Covid-positive case that went on to tour Wellington. Cases in Sydney exploded, the border between the countries was shut, and I was trapped in New Zealand. I had meant to surprise my girlfriend with a week-long visit, but I accidentally surprised her with … moving into her home. There’s a popular joke stereotype about lesbians “U-Hauling”, which means moving in together shortly after beginning to date, but I think surprise moving-in from overseas after spending three weeks together in real life takes the cake. Luckily, my tendency to overprepare came in handy in this instance as even though I was only coming for a week, I had packed enough underwear to dress a family of five for months. And even though I hadn’t planned it – I hadn’t said goodbye to anyone, I had told my housemates I would be back in a week, and I hadn’t brought anything important with me – it all worked out, and I was able to settle in as if it had been my plan all along. It has almost been a year now, and it has been a strange experience, but a blessed one. Everyone has been so welcoming (we won’t mention the one older relative of my girlfriend’s who is OK with the fact she’s dating a woman, but not impressed that I am Australian) and excited to show me around. Wellington is beautiful, and I have loved getting to unexpectedly notice the little differences you pick up when you spend enough time in one place. For example, everyone here is obsessed with their native birds, and talking about birds. If you are in a group of three or more people, at some point someone in that group will begin talking about kākāpō breeding season, or will gather around in a garden to see an unusually coloured pīwakawaka. After gently teasing them about this for months, I recently found myself thinking about how the takahē and kākāpō are actually much more interesting flightless birds than the kiwi, so they should be as famous in Australia … and I knew they had gotten to me. I have delighted them in return, by making sure to share with everyone two important pieces of Australian culture they don’t know about – Steven Bradbury and Bob Katter. My favourite difference is how te reo Māori is used here. It’s not just included on signage and official forms, or talked about once a year on a designated day – it’s everywhere you go. Almost every pākehā (New Zealand European) I have met casually uses some reo Māori in conversation. It’s a small sample size, but they have all been able to teach me about the history of colonisation in this country, of important events, of the racist framework the country is based on. But equally as important, they are familiar with Māori stories of the land we are on. I say this not to praise white people for doing the absolute bare minimum, or to declare everything is perfect in Aotearoa when it clearly isn’t; I say it to emphasise how completely and utterly barren white Australia is in comparison. Living somewhere for a bit and seeing how achievable the bare minimum is makes me ashamed on a daily basis at how far behind we are. There are also other stark points of difference. For example, the sweet’n’sour sauce at McDonald’s tastes weird. Whatever the differences, and even though McNuggets taste worse, I now consider this place my second home. My spontaneity in coming to visit when I did was not only rewarded, but it actually saved us. If I hadn’t made the decision to fly that quickly, the border would have shut with me on one side and my girlfriend on the other. We would have been apart for another year. I haven’t watched Sliding Doors for a long time, but I think that timeline would be the one where Gwyneth dies. This experience, and the pandemic in general, has definitely made me more spontaneous, and a bit more audacious. Should a friend stay in her new well-paying job, or should she fly to Spain to reunite with an ex for a chance at love? The “before” me would have told her to keep that steady work. Now? I’ll take her to the damn airport myself. But we’ll still be really early. Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in Aotearoa, for now"
Caroline Kennedy praises Australia’s bipartisan foreign policy despite PM’s claims on Labor and China ,2022-04-07T21:21:42Z,Daniel Hurst Foreign affairs and defence correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zh7,"Caroline Kennedy, the nominee for US ambassador to Australia, has said the Aukus security deal will provide “a lot of deterrence” in the Indo-Pacific even before the nuclear-powered submarines are ready. With Australia set to enter a federal election campaign within days, Kennedy praised the country for standing firm with “a bipartisan foreign policy” in the face of “Chinese economic coercion”. But she also said the prospect of a security agreement between China and Solomon Islands showed the US needed to be “more visible” in the Pacific. Kennedy said the US move to reopen its embassy in Solomon Islands “can’t come soon enough”. Kennedy, a former ambassador to Japan and the daughter of John F Kennedy, described the US relationship with Australia as vital when she addressed the US Senate committee on foreign relations early on Friday Australia time. The hearing is a crucial step before US senators vote on whether to confirm her as ambassador. Kennedy mentioned Beijing’s trade actions against a range of Australian export sectors – including coal, barley and wine – that the Australian government viewed as an attempt to pressure it to change its policies on China. “Australia most recently has been challenged by Chinese economic coercion and I think that the United States can learn a lot from their response,” Kennedy told the confirmation hearing. “They’ve stood firm and I think they’ve managed to come together with a bipartisan foreign policy and I think a greater and deeper partnership with us in the security and diplomatic areas as well as across the board.” Kennedy was careful not to wade into Australian domestic politics. But her acknowledgment of bipartisan foreign policy is notable, given that the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has previously attempted to claim the Labor opposition would be weak on China. The Republican former presidential candidate Mitt Romney told the confirmation hearing the US had been “very impressed by the backbone that’s been shown by the people of Australia”. Some critics have questioned the significance of last September’s Aukus agreement, given that the first of Australia’s new nuclear-propelled submarines are not expected to be operating until the late 2030s. But Kennedy said the “ambitious 21st century partnership” of Australia, the US and the UK was much broader than submarines. Other areas of security cooperation under the Aukus banner included artificial intelligence, quantum and cyber, she said. This week the three countries added discussions on hypersonic weapons to the list. “I think that there is a lot of deterrence that it will deliver well before the submarines are in operation,” Kennedy said. She also described the Quad – an increasingly active diplomatic grouping of Australia, the US, Japan and India – as “a very powerful alliance and combination”. China, which is rapidly modernising its own military force, has criticised both Aukus and the Quad. Beijing argues the US is trying to form “an exclusive clique” while “stoking opposition and confrontation”. Kennedy said the Indo-Pacific had became “increasingly tense” since her time as US ambassador to Japan from 2013 to 2017, and the liberal international order was being “undermined”. The climate crisis was also raised at the hearing, amid efforts by the Biden administration to encourage Australia to take more ambitious medium-term action. Robert Menendez, the committee chairman, said Australia was “a microcosm of the global climate crisis”. He noted the impact of recent flooding disasters in Queensland and New South Wales, the Black Summer bushfires, and threats to the Great Barrier Reef. “This is an incredibly important relationship,” Menendez said. “But there are great lessons for the United States to learn how to prepare for such extreme climate disasters and how to get Australia to think about the climate responsibilities they have as well, in their own interests as well as the global interest.” Kennedy said: “Certainly Australia has learned a lot about these kinds of disasters and we also have been impacted by fires and floods and storms here in the United States. “So the more that we can learn … how to combat and also move toward a clean energy transition and reduce the impacts of climate change, the faster we can do that [the better]. If confirmed, I would be eager to work on that.” The US has been pressing Australia to strengthen its 2030 emission reduction target, but the Coalition has kept it at the Tony Abbott-era level of a 26% to 28% cut compared with 2005 levels. Labor pledges to cut emissions by 43% by 2030 if elected. When Joe Biden announced the nomination of Kennedy four months ago, both major Australian political parties welcomed the choice, seeing it as a senior appointment of a well-connected figure who would have the president’s ear. Without a US ambassador in place in Canberra, senior diplomat Mike Goldman has been serving as the embassy’s charge d’affaires."
"Braga 1-0 Rangers: Europa League quarter-final, first leg – as it happened",2022-04-07T18:00:09Z,John Brewin,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z95,"Here’s Nick Ames’s match report. Rangers’ Scott Arfield speaks to BT Sport. A bit different, at times it was like a basketball game, two teams trying to win it. We take it back to Ibrox and we feel we can win this game, every time you come against this calibre. they are going to be good. They made it difficult, they created overloads. I feel like we can win this tie. The fans travelled in numbers, we will have 45,000 behind us. It was always going to be difficult, it’s only half-time. Morelos is a big player, there’s no doubt. Everyone needs to adapt, he’s a big miss. It’s all about us playing to each other’s strengths, Alfredo can’t play until end of the season. He can’t help us. There’s no doom and gloom, we’ve set it up for next week. Back to Ibrox it goes, and with such a slim advantage for Braga then Rangers must fancy they can find a way back. For much of the second half they were the better team and will have their home crowd behind them. 1-0, under the new rules, with no away goals, is a decent result. The semis are not out of reach. 90+3 min: One last push from Rangers, getting it launched down the Braga end before the full-time whistle goes. 90+2 min: Rangers the better team for the last 20 minutes or so, with Braga’s youngsters tiring. They have missed Morelos’s finishing and devilment in attack, though. 90 min: Three minutes added on as Rangers force a corner, one that almost lands at the feet of Goldson who shapes to shoot before a pile of Braga bodies get in the way. 89 min: Goldson’s cute header at the back post sets up a set of shots at the Braga defence, the ball pinging around before the keeper claims with some relief. 88 min: Kamara and Aribo try to link in midfield, but the ball goes back to Bassey before Roofe is fouled, right on the edge of the box, Carmo made the foul, having already been booked. He escapes a second yellow. 86 min: Lundstram surges on for Rangers but his pass to Arfield is poor, just like so much of Rangers’ passing game this weekend. 84 min: Still no Ramsey. His stay at Ibrox is reaching the level of oddity. 81 min: A break in play as there’s some cramp in the Braga ranks. A long break, too, before Andre Horta comes off. Mineiro on, as Al Musrati comes off and Castro comes on. 79 min: Braga happy to settle for 1-0? Carlos Carvahal always struck as a coach who liked to attack, so perhaps not. 77 min: Horta and Horta, the Braga brothers, link up, and Rangers have to get bodies in the way to block them off, eventually Andre Horta shoots and Allan McGregor knocks the ball behind to take the safety option. 75 min: Braga change: off go Medeiros and Ruiz, Miguel Fale and Vitor Oliveira on, Vitinha for short. 73 min: Braga no longer quite so fluid as before, and Arfield gets to the byline, and Roofe steps out and decides to take it first time, only to smash the ball into the direction of that great bit sea cliff. He might have taken a touch there, anything but that. He was attempting a volley Marco van Basten would have baulked at attempting. 71 min: Close for Rangers! Bassey makes Beckenbauer-esque surge from defence that sets up a Rangers attack, and Arfield forces a corner, and Tavernier will take it. It swings across goal, and Goldson is there to head it. And he misses the target! Had to do better. 69 min: Roofe complains that he is manhandled as he chases down the channel. It’s been been lone furrows for the Rangers forwards for much of the game. 67 min: A glimmer for Braga, Gomes cuts in from the left and wings in a shot that lands in Allan McGregor’s midriff. 66 min: Lundstram’s long ball is aimed for Aribo is cleared away. But it’s been a better half so far from Rangers, even if they are lacking the quality to make much of an impact on Braga. 64 min: Early involvement for Roofe, but he slips on to Aribo’s pass and handles it as he falls in the box. There’s a very weak attempt to claim a penalty. 62 min: And here they come, how might they affect the play now that Rangers have come back into the game? On come Barisic, Roofe and Aribo, off come Balogun, Sakala and Jack. A reshuffle is in place and each of those players have not had the easiest nights. 60 min: Rangers changes imminent is the word... 59 min: Braga try to re-establish dominance but Rangers have regained their shape, and kept it tight. Braga are reduced to passing the ball around in non-dangerous areas. 57 min: Arfield tries to charge down Matheus but ends up being tricked by the goalie, not that it won’t have sent shivers down the spine of Braga’s fans. It was risky. Fabiano also fouls Kamara, and that results in a free kick that comes to Arfield to swing at. The ball is cleared away. Rangers with momentum? Possibly. 55 min: From nowhere, Rangers get a corner, and Tavernier must do better with this one. Abel Ruiz climbs highest to head clear for Braga. 54 min: Couto continues to cause havoc, and Rangers continue to struggle get the ball clear and up. They are defending well at the moment but need to maintain their concentration. 52 min: Kamara is trying his best to get on the ball but Rangers are struggling to make the ball stick at the moment; nobody is holding it for long. That sets up myriad Braga attacks, and allows them to control possession. 50 min: Lundstram forces the ball down the field, with Braga pushing hard on to Rangers players. It feels like there are more Braga players on the field at the moment. 48 min: Medeiros, Couto and Orta carve some pretty patterns with their passing; Braga are a quality outfit. Couto, who is giving the Rangers left flank a terrible chasing, wins a corner, though one cleared easily. 46 min: Back away we go, no Rangers changes, no Aaron Ramsey. You remember him, Aaron Ramsey, good for Wales. After starting so well, Rangers began to cough up chances and having escaped a VAR-assisted goal, Abel Ruiz struck. In the dressing room, Gio has work to do to work out how to prevent those pacy counters. There is potential gold amid Braga’s shaky defence if Rangers can step forward a bit more. 45+3 min: Gomes, clearly feeling better, speeds past Tavernier then Kamara, showing off what is a clear talent. 45+2 min: Arfield, Jack and Lundstram are chased down in the corner. Braga’s energy is winning out here. 45 min: Rangers build up an attack then ends with a John Lundstram shot, only for an offside flag to be waved. Four minutes added on to this half. 44 min: Braga are a man down as Gomes has taken a knock jumping up for the ball on the touchline. He’ll be OK to continue but takes his time. 42 min: Braga had come more and more into it, finding space down the wing, with Couto against Kent something of a mismatch for Kent’s defensive capabilities. Poor defending from Balogun, who sticks out a leg as a pass from the excellent Couto finds the striker who smashes it beyond Allan McGregor and in. No VAR this time, a fine goal but one that could have been far better defended. 39 min: Rangers sitting back a little bit more, and having to be wary of the excellent Couto. 37 min: A break in play as Ryan Jack takes a knock. He looks a tad roughed up. 36 min: Matt Burtz is in: “I’m aware that Max Rushden describes you as music hipster, but what’s wrong with Def Leppard? Personally, I could usually use more Def Leppard in my life.” Nothing, I had Pyromania on just this morning. Great band, nice blokes, proper Sheffield. I saw them promote When Love And Hate Collide at Bramall Lane in 1995, hence the reference. 34 min: Zakala turns Tormena and has time and space to shoot. He wastes what is his best chance so far. The Braga defenders are not the quickest. 32 min: Ryan Kent scampers away, and looks to have found his way through, only for Couto to quell the danger. Yan Couto, by the way, is on loan from Manchester City, having already played for sister club Girona. 31 min: Braga force a corner from one of those wildcat attacks but Rangers scramble it clear, looking far less sure of themselves as they did 15 minutes ago or so. Ricardo Orta is a growing force in this game, as are Medeiros and Couto. 28 min: A let-off for Rangers, they had let their guard down, and allowed Braga space and time in their box. Ryan Jack was taken out in the melee from which Orta scored, and went down. The ref ran off to the TV screen to check and we all know what that means. Back to parity. The goal came from a similar position as the previous chance, Couto down the wing, a couple of chances to clear the ball go begging, and off Tavernier, the Braga skipper buries it... 24 min: Braga smash the post! A speedy break. Ricardo Horta smashes the ball after a Couto cross from the flank causes chaos. It comes off the post and back out when he might have done better with his finish. 22 min: Braga’s Carmo is booked for clattering Kamara, whose speed from deep is causing problems. Tavernier takes the set piece and makes a mess of it again. He needs to do better, the skipper, on those dead balls. 21 min: Braga, having to take a breather after being given something of a buffeting by Rangers, choose to rest on the ball with some gentle passing. 19 min: Rangers free-kick from the left after Kamara is bundled over, Tavernier’s kick smashes off the face of someone in the wall. Rangers keep up the pressure. 18 min: Rangers have most of the ball but need be wary of opponents whose young, zesty legs make them ideal for the speeding counter. 16 min: Sakala climbs but Carmo, Braga’s hulking defender, climbs higher and stronger. 15 min: Desperate defending from Braga’s Al Musrati as Sakala is played the ball in a dangerous position in the six-yard box. Rangers stepping this up, looking to have far more threat. 13 min: Sakala is sent down the right, and he looks to have the beating of his opposing full-back for pace, though this time hits the first defender. More glimmers of hope for Rangers. 12 min: Braga need to gain back control here, Rangers keep winning back possession, though they too have been a little wasteful. This game continues to be wide open. 10 min: A jink from Kent and a pass out wide Arfield opens up space. Rangers have a route through the Braga defence, it seems. Time to exploit that. 9 min: It looks like Matheus, the Braga goalie, may no longer be able to carry on, having hurt himself in that Kent half-chance. Looks like a muscle problem. He says he is OK to carry on, but is limping. The advice to Rangers plays now is to shoot on sight. 7 min: This is an open game. Both of them pressing hard, going at each other. Peter Oh joins us: “Re: the rock face on one end of the Braga ground. I would love to see Granit Xhaka play on this pitch, blooter a crushing shot well over the crossbar, with the ball bursting from the impact with the sheer cliff.” 5 min: Chaos in the Braga box. Arfield takes the ball from Goldson and the ball is good, then Kent storms in but his first touch is a little too high. He might have done better there and Matheus in the Braga goal came out to smother the ball and didn’t exactly look the bravest. 4 min: Braga pushing on. Medeiros, for whom nothing’s gonna change my love, gets down the right side, cuts in and is blocked off. Already, they look a decent quality opponent for Rangers. 2 min: A speeding Ryan Kent almost gets down the right, but Braga clear and attack with speed of their own. Goldson has to step out to clear the danger. Both teams favour speedy attacks, we can safely say. 1 min: And away we go in Portugal, where the atmosphere is bouncing, the home fans really turning it on. The three-sided ground reminds of the Bramall Lane of the 1990s, but with a bit more atmosphere, nicer weather and a bit less Def Leppard and Dave Bassett. Allan McGregor is making a century of European appearance tonight, the 40-year-old veteran who didn’t have the best Old Firm match at the weekend. Ok, here we go in the quarter-final, with Rangers having travelled further in the competition than any other Scottish club; they reached the final of the old Uefa Cup in 2008 under the late, great Walter Smith. These two met in this competition two years ago, back in the days of Stevie G. Rangers should have extended the 3-2 lead with which they travelled to Portugal during the first half but wasted three chances – with Ianis Hagi becoming their fourth player this season to miss a penalty. But Kent sealed Rangers’ place in the draw on Friday 16 minutes after the break to send the 5,000 fans who had journeyed from Scotland wild and now Gerrard hopes it will help the Englishman return to his best. Gio van Bronckhorst speaks to BT in Braga. Big opportunity, great to be involved in Europe still. We have one goal to go to the semis. Disappointment’s a big part of footbal;, especially when you lose to Celtic. The focus was switched to today. You want to see a reaction, a desire, we have a big squad, and it’s a tie over two games. [Braga]’s a good team, you don’t beat Sheriff and Monaco if you are not a good team. We have to be ready. Nice view of an amazing stadium. More from Carlos Carvahal, speaking to BT about those youngsters. He loves to talk. They are not afraid of anything, they want to fight. So far the team is growing since the start of the season. I am very happy with team. The Scottish fans starts the party already, the Braga fans will come a bit later. I think it will be a fantastic game. All the teams in he world have weak points and we will try to exploit the weak points of Glasgow Rangers. Some quotes from the Braga manager, Carlos Carvahal, via the BBC. We’ve got the youngest team left in the Europa League. We have a lot of boys with very good quality. David Carmo was linked last year with Liverpool. We have a lot of talented players aged 17, 18, 19 who want to play in England. They now have a good opportunity to show their abilities to the clubs across the world. Braga is the stadium where one side of the pitch faces a cliff wall, it’s one of the most picturesque places to visit in Europe. But what other cultural delights might the Rangers faithful have found? There’s contemporary photography in the Museu da Imagem, which spans two historic buildings: one from the 19th century and a tower from the 14th that was part of the original city wall, and innovative design at the Chapel Tree of Life (open to the public Fridays at 5pm) within the centuries-old seminary of São Pedro and São Paulo. This slatted structure, constructed solely of wood (with no nails or hinges), is suffused with light and evokes the serenity of the nearby forests while providing a singular example of the power of modern architecture. Braga’s social media team have chosen a rather Tolkienesque font. What does that mean? Aaron Ramsey was supposed to start but doesn’t, and drops to the bench alongside Joe Aribo and Kemar Roofe, while Glen Kamara, Scott Arfield and Fashion Sakala come in. There’s talk that Gio Van Bronckhorst has opted for a back three, and it does look like a hard-working, more defensively minded team. To quote Rangers’ website: That means it’s a back five of Allan McGregor in goal with James Tavernier, Connor Goldson, Leon Balogun and Calvin Bassey in front of him. Kamara joins John Lundstram and Ryan Jack in the middle of the park, while up front, Arfield and Ryan Kent will play in support of Fashion Jr. Braga: Matheus, Y. Couto, Fabiano, Tormena, Carmo, Al Musrati, Medeiros, A. Horta, R. Horta, Ruiz, Gomes Subs: Hornicek, Sa, Buta, Leite, P. Oliveira, Rodrigues, Castro, B. Cuoto, Mineiro, Moura, Fale, V. Oliveira Rangers: McGregor, Tavernier, Goldson, Balogun, Bassey, Jack, Lundstram, Kamara, Arfield, Sakala, Kent. Subs: McCrorie, McLaughlin, Wright, Barisic, Davis, Aribo, Sands, Ramsey, Diallo, Roofe. Last Sunday hurt for Rangers. When Aaron Ramsey scored that early goal against Celtic, all seemed to be going to plan only for things to fall apart and the title race may be all but lost. And then there was that unpleasantness with bottles being thrown. Still, Europe has been a sanctuary for Rangers this season, away from the pain of losing Steven Gerrard and a distraction from domestic matters. Braga, who reached the final of this competition back in 2011, are coming off a 3-2 win over Benfica at the weekend, and sit fourth in the Portuguese Liga table behind the three traditional powers. Of course, Rangers will have to do this without Alfredo Morelos, ruled out for the season, and come up against a familiar face in Carlos Carvahal, once of Swansea and Sheffield Wednesday, who is in charge of the youngest team in the competition. Portugal is always a crucible of talent, so could be some stars of the future on show. Not that Rangers will be admiring the talent, going as far in the competition as possible is the aim. Kick-off is at 8pm UK time. Join me."
Barnes and Iheanacho fail to take chances as Leicester are held by PSV,2022-04-07T21:11:49Z,Ben Fisher at the King Power Stadium,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pdc,"It was not the perfect evening for Leicester but it would be foolish to be too downbeat on a European night when they largely muted a free-scoring PSV team that have put four and five goals past opponents in recent weeks. The again impressive Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall compared it to a chess match and Brendan Rodgers was rightly encouraged by his side’s vibrant display, even if they failed to find a priceless winner to take to the Netherlands. For supporters, this was a lively contest that served to further whet the appetite for their second-leg meeting in Eindhoven next week, when a semi-final berth in the inaugural Europa Conference League will be up for grabs. This was Leicester’s first European quarter-final since they exited the Champions League against Atlético Madrid under Craig Shakespeare five years ago and while it would not be their competition of choice Rodgers had stressed that his side are in no position to turn their noses up at the prospect of a trophy. The reality is this tournament is Leicester’s best route into Europe next season, as well as their last chance of silverware this campaign. Kelechi Iheanacho scooped wide from close range after seizing on an André Ramalho lapse and Harvey Barnes rattled the upright a minute before half-time but Leicester were fortunate to survive a penalty scare when Cody Gakpo was caught in the box. They almost got off to a disastrous start but Mario Götze, played onside by Ricardo Pereira, was thwarted by Kasper Schmeichel’s right hand after spying a delicious reverse pass by Joey Veerman. It was a game played at a frenetic pace, with crisp passes and neat triangles, but both sides were guilty of lacking poise in front of goal. Iheanacho had Rodgers cursing, the striker’s loose touch abruptly ending a Leicester break. Rodgers required a gulp of water. PSV’s England Under-21 winger Noni Madueke, a player being tracked by Leicester, saw a shot deflected wide and the forward’s pace caused problems, at one point leaving four blue shirts lagging behind him. Jonny Evans made an important intervention in defence but Leicester had the better chances. Timothy Castagne saw a shot blocked inside the box after Ibrahim Sangaré’s poor clearance dropped kindly but Mvogo was quieter than Rodgers would have liked. For PSV, backed by a vociferous pocket of supporters, there were also plenty of positives. Things were delicately balanced, the occasion seemingly ready to be determined by one false move and seven minutes into the second half Pereira appeared fortunate there was no VAR to take a second look at his brush with Gakpo. The PSV forward cut inside and Pereira made contact in the box but the appeals were turned away by the referee, Ivan Kruzliak. “I’ve seen it [again]. It was a clear penalty,” said the PSV head coach Roger Schmidt. “I think we played a really good game but we had to suffer sometimes.” Wesley Fofana was imperious in defence, superbly raking the ball from Eran Zahavi but there were frustrations for Rodgers, who turned on the touchline and winced when Marc Albrighton’s aimless pass upfield was easily gobbled up by a PSV defender. Rodgers expects PSV, who trail Ajax by four points in the Eredivisie, to be more open in the return leg and if so his players may have space to prosper. “At times we showed our lack of experience, but that will come,” the Leicester manager said. “In particular in the first half too many times we were breaking through, three v five, and we were trying to force it. At times we played some really good football.” Leicester have now lost one of their past 13 matches here and, apart from Götze’s early chance, Schmeichel was rarely troubled. Another Madueke surge, this time from halfway, put Leicester on the back foot but the attack fizzled out and Castagne would have been pleased to see the former Tottenham youngster withdrawn with nine minutes to play. Rodgers introduced Patson Daka at the same time, in place of Albrighton, whose nutmeg on Philipp Max drew gasps from a sold-out home crowd. But an entertaining game was bereft of the all-important finishing touch."
West Ham battle to Europa League draw with Lyon after Cresswell’s red card,2022-04-07T21:09:26Z,Jacob Steinberg at the London Stadium,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pd6,"The dream seemed to be over at half-time. West Ham had just lost Aaron Cresswell to a hugely controversial red card and at that stage it was hard not to feel that Lyon were going to run away with this Europa League quarter-final. But David Moyes has made West Ham tough. Powered by injustice after seeing Felix Zwayer dismiss Cresswell for fouling Moussa Dembele, the 10 men dug in and took the lead through Jarrod Bowen. Lyon had to scrap and West Ham will travel to France with hope next week, even though Tanguy Ndombele cancelled out their lead. It was far too early for West Ham to start thinking about a potential semi-final against Barcelona. This was another imposing test and Moyes knew better than to focus on the odds favouring his team. After all, Lyon were Champions League semi-finalists two years ago and, although their domestic form has been inconsistent this season, they remain an accomplished team and it quickly became clear that they were capable of making life uncomfortable for West Ham. It was a classic case of an experienced side drawing the sting from the occasion. Roared on by a passionate home crowd, West Ham overwhelmed Sevilla in the last 16 and Lyon did not want to suffer a similar fate. They wanted the game to be played at their pace and their intricate passing soon caused problems. There were possibilities when Lyon played through Houssem Aouar and the opening goal almost arrived when Lucas Paquetá broke down the left, only for Dembélé to turn the Brazilian’s cross wide. Playing in their first European quarter-final since 1981, West Ham were edgy for a while. Tomas Soucek and Declan Rice struggled to keep the ball away from Tanguy Ndombele and Thiago Mendes, although there was hope on the break. They threatened when Craig Dawson’s raking ball released Saïd Benrahma, whose shot was saved by Anthony Lopes, then when Michail Antonio rumbled through and saw his effort blocked by Castello Lukeba. On the whole, though, Lukeba and Jérôme Boateng stood up to Antonio. West Ham were not measured enough in the final third, with Jarrod Bowen unable to affect the game from the right, and there were howls of frustration when Benrahma wasted a couple of promising positions. The game had become cagey. Rice drew a good save from Lopes from 20 yards. Boateng, Ndombele and Malo Gusto wound up the crowd by making too much of nothing challenges. Little was happening and it was hard to imagine that Moyes would be waiting on the touchline to berate the officials at half-time, West Ham’s manager incandescent after seeing his side reduced to 10 men when Cresswell’s foul on Dembélé was deemed to have denied the Lyon forward a clear goalscoring opportunity. It was hugely questionable from Zwayer, who had waved away Bowen’s appeals for a free-kick moments before Aouar sent Dembélé racing beyond Kurt Zouma. Dembélé even winked at his teammates after Cresswell was ordered off for a foolish tug of his opponent’s shirt. The striker’s touch had taken him away from goal, while Zouma was covering, and it felt ludicrous that there was no intervention from VAR. Moyes was booked for his protests, although he will probably have questions about Cresswell’s defending as well. West Ham’s left-back had panicked and his dismissal tilted the contest in Lyon’s favour, especially with Benrahma off and Ben Johnson as an extra defender. Inevitably Lyon dominated territory. West Ham, though, had a plan of attack. They threatened when Antonio ran at Lukeba, then when Fornals dribbled in from the left. Suddenly Lyon were ragged. Gusto did not do enough to stop Fornals and when the Spaniard prodded the ball on to Boateng it ran through to Bowen, whose messy shot hit the Lyon defender and bounced over Lopes. West Ham chased a second, Antonio going close. Lyon needed fresh ideas and Peter Bosz sent on Tetê and Karl Toko Ekambi for Boateng and Romain Faivre. The changes paid off instantly, Tetê dribbling beyond Johnson and firing in a low ball that Alphonse Areola and Ryan Fredericks failed to clear, allowing Ndombele to equalise from close range. From there The question was whether Lyon would score again. West Ham refused to let it happen."
Abel Ruiz’s winner gives Braga narrow first-leg victory over Rangers,2022-04-07T21:07:31Z,Nick Ames,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pcq,"Rangers needed a response to the weekend’s crushing setback against Celtic, which effectively ended their title hopes, and did enough here to ensure their Europa League quarter-final remains finely poised. The regret will be that they conceded to Braga’s Abel Ruiz in the 40th minute during the only spell when they were truly under the cosh. Otherwise they showed up well in a largely uneventful affair and will consider the Portuguese side vulnerable at Ibrox. The big encouragement Rangers can hold is that they have passed this very test before, albeit with wins in both legs. In February 2020 they beat Braga twice in the round of 32, winning the away fixture with a goal from Ryan Kent. Within five minutes of kick-off he had come close to repeating the trick: a beautiful ball from Scott Arfield created the chance, sending Kent free, but a heavy touch allowed the goalkeeper Matheus to shovel away. Fashion Sakala’s follow-up was blocked but the episode characterised Rangers’ lively start. Arfield then almost located Sakala after slick play by Kent. Braga were concerned when Matheus needed treatment as a result of that early intervention and there was little reason to expect Rangers could not continue thriving. Braga were rattled by their visitors’ speed. Glen Kamara, one of three reintroductions to the starting XI after their Old Firm defeat, was hauled over by one centre-back, Fabiano, and then chopped down by another in David Carmo. When examined, though, Rangers courted danger. A cross from Yan Couto, the excellent Manchester City loanee, caused consternation that led to Ricardo Horta rapping the post. Then the other Horta, his brother André, found the bottom corner but VAR intervened for an infringement by Fabiano. In response Sakala blasted over but five minutes before the break Braga exposed them critically. A smart right-sided move ended with Ruiz, who got an awkward ball out of his feet and whipped low around Allan McGregor from 15 yards. This time it counted. Matheus earned applause with a dink to get past Arfield 10 minutes after the interval. Rangers had held their own since half-time without getting behind their hosts. Arfield saw one volley blocked; Braga were hardly overcommitting and a sense grew of the scoreline being mutually acceptable. A triple substitution by Giovanni van Bronckhorst, with Kemar Roofe among those introduced, suggested that might not necessarily be the case but proceedings were scratchy and tight. In the 71st minute, though, Connor Goldson should have levelled when the Braga defence froze at a corner. He was all alone and had to do better than head wide. Rangers pressed late on and, had Alfredo Morelos not been ruled out for the season’s remainder, perhaps he would have conjured something. As it is, the tie remains alive. “We know the task ahead,” Van Bronckhorst said. “Next week we play at home with the crowd behind us. The atmosphere is very hostile, overwhelming at times, and you saw after 70 minutes [Braga] dropped their energy levels a bit. We have to give all our energy to get into the semis.”"
Tiger Woods stays steady as flashes of magic suggest there’s more to come,2022-04-07T21:00:50Z,Andy Bull at Augusta,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pet,"They say there were about 50,000 people at Augusta National for the start of the Masters: fans, media, members, stewards, caddies, cooks, camera crew and support staff, almost every one of them asking the same question. It felt like most of them had come along to the 1st tee at 11 in the morning to try to find out the answer, too. The dogged ones had staked a front-row spot first thing. Everyone else was left craning their necks and popping up on their tiptoes, jockeying to try to find a line of sight that would allow them to catch a flash of Tiger Woods in his shocking pink shirt. Could Woods really do it? Even Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player were yakking back and forth about it. Nicklaus wasn’t sure. “Feeling competitive is different than feeling like you can win,” Nicklaus said after he had hit the ceremonial tee-shot, “I mean, I’m sure Tiger will be very competitive this week. I don’t know whether he can win or not. He hasn’t played any competition golf for a long time.” Player disagreed. “There’s no reason why not. As long as he does something which is absolutely imperative, and that’s to believe that he can.” There’s no doubt about that part at least. Woods said himself he wouldn’t be here otherwise. The fun part would be in finding out whether he was kidding himself, and everyone else, when he said his game was up to it. It became clear pretty quickly that he wasn’t. We don’t know how he will handle the recovery and whether his body will hold up through four days of play, but we do know that he wasn’t lying when he said he still had his touch. Woods covered the five holes in even par, although when his first putt went in the roar was so loud that it tricked a lot of people into thinking he must have done something spectacular. Since his name wasn’t up on any of the big white scoreboards dotted around the course, and Augusta’s strict rules meant that no one had a phone handy to tell them any better, the whisper went around the grounds that he had in fact birdied the first. “He’s in great shape to make another,” said a man at the 2nd after Woods had hit his second shot down to the slope in front right of the green. “I heard he couldn’t even swing after the accident,” someone said as Woods was standing over his chip, “he was like a total beginner.” He was all anybody was talking about. “I think his win here in ’19 was the greatest comeback ever”, and “none of us had him to win then, either” and “I think he’s going to run out of steam” and “just making the cut here would be a win for him” and “I can’t wait to tell my mama that I saw Tiger Woods”. His partners, Louis Oosthuizen and Joaquín Niemann, didn’t figure in the conversation, even though the latter was playing some brilliant golf. Woods on the other hand was playing some good, steady stuff, a little less spectacular than the crowd would have liked maybe. They were quiet when he left a poor putt from off the front of the green short on the 3rd and again on the 4th when he missed with another putt from the fringe. It felt as if he was feeling his way back into it in tricky conditions. The course had been softened by two days of torrential rain but the sub-air drainage system was hard at work, sucking up the groundwater. Overhead the wind was starting to carry away the thick cold, clouds and drizzle. By the time the group got to the 5th, the sun was out for the first time all week. The crowd sighed for him there, when a 15ft birdie putt caught the lip and flipped out, and they roared again at the 6th when he picked up his first birdie (for real this time) after hitting his tee-shot to 2ft. His recovery at the 7th was even better. His drive fetched up in a patch of pine straw down the right side, nestled between three tree trunks, but he whipped his second right up to the front of the green, 30 yards shy, then hit a superb chip to 2ft. “Well you can break my leg,” one man said. “And stick a metal rod in it too,” his friend chimed in. Woods always did know how to get himself out of a tight spot. He did drop a shot at the next after he missed the green with his first chip and hit his second 5ft by. And it all started to get a little wild after that. There were some bad misses, some brilliant recoveries and a couple of breathtaking putts. He saved par after he hit a wild drive at the 9th but didn’t when he made the mistake again, worse this time, at the 14th, where his foot almost seemed to slip as he was midway through his swing. That bogey cost him the shot he had just picked up at the 13th where he had a tap-in after his eagle putt from 23ft finished short. The 15th was hairy too as he hopped his way down through the trees along the left side and flopped on to the green. And then he pulled out a 29ft birdie putt at the par-3 16th. And at the end of it all, he was one under par. He is going to compete, Nicklaus was right about that. By Sunday we’ll find out whether Player was right that he could win it, too."
"Morning mail: Russia suspended from UN human rights council, fresh Aukus controversy, record frogs",2022-04-07T20:54:25Z,Melissa Godin,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7q38,"Good morning. Russia’s war in Ukraine “going to be a long slog” America’s top General Mark Milley has warned. In Australia, more residents have been ordered to evacuate their homes in NSW amid predictions of historic flooding. It comes as Sydney surpasses its average annual rainfall in just over three months of 2022. Russia has been suspended from the United Nations’ leading human rights body as its invasion of Ukraine continues to provoke revulsion and outrage around the world. At a meeting of the UN general assembly on Thursday, 93 members voted in favour of the diplomatic rebuke while 24 were against and 58 abstained. “War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted in response. “Grateful to all member states which … chose the right side of history.” Radio transmissions in which Russian soldiers appear to talk among themselves about carrying out premeditated civilian killings in Ukraine have been intercepted by Germany’s foreign intelligence service, a source close to the findings has said. And Western observers fear that genocidal language in Russian media may prompt more war crimes. Australian Border Force officials searched 822 travellers’ mobile phones in 2021, despite admitting it has no power to force arrivals to give them the passcode to their devices. In January, Sydney software developer James told Guardian Australia that he and his partner were stopped on their return from Fiji by border force officials who asked them to write their phone passcodes on a piece of paper before taking the codes and their phones to another room to examine for half an hour. The phones were then returned and they were allowed to leave. Border force confirmed the practice was allowed under the Customs Act, but declined to expand on how often it was used, or what officers did with the devices once unlocked. Facebook owner Meta Platforms has removed a network of social media accounts with ties to the Brazilian military that posed as fake non-profits to play down the dangers of deforestation. The comments by Meta, published in a quarterly report, pose a reputational risk to Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro. The far-right former army captain, a longtime sceptic of environmentalism, has deployed the armed forces to the Amazon on unsuccessful missions to reduce destruction of the world’s largest rainforest. Although the individuals involved in the network were active military personnel, Meta’s investigation did not find enough evidence to establish if they were following orders or acting independently, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Australia Craig Kelly is being investigated for billing taxpayers to fly to anti-vaccine mandate, anti-lockdown rallies in Melbourne, internal records show.

North Korea could be planning its first nuclear weapon test in nearly five years, according to a senior US official who urged the regime to step back from further provocations following its recent long-range missile test. Britain is preparing to unveil a fresh package of military aid for Ukraine and has demonstrated new missile systems and armoured vehicles that it believes can help Kyiv in the next phases of fighting. Recommended reads Armed conflict between the world’s two superpowers, while not yet inevitable, has become a real possibility, Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia warns. But apocalyptic thinking, he says, is not the solution. “We have arrived at a point in the long evolution of the US-China relationship when serious analysts and commentators increasingly assume that some form of crisis, conflict or even war is inevitable. This thinking is dangerous. The advantage of diplomatic history – if we study it seriously – is that the risk of talking ourselves into a crisis is real.” Yuri Possokhov’s beautiful and distilled version of Leo Tolstoy’s epic tale Anna Karenina is a ballet for adults rather than children: no lavish “chocolate-box” elements, no snow on stage, no one arrives in a troika, there are no ballrooms.

Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed as first Black woman on US supreme court – as it happened,2022-04-07T13:20:24Z,Richard Luscombe,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zny,"We’re closing down the blog now after a day dominated by the historic confirmation by the US Senate of the first Black judge, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to a seat on the US supreme court. Please join us again tomorrow, when Joe Biden will talk about Jackson’s confirmation from the White House, and for what will surely be another busy day in US politics. Remember you can continue to follow developments in the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our live blog here. Here’s where else our day went: The New York attorney general Letitia James filed for a contempt order against Donald Trump for his refusal to cooperate with her inquiry into his business dealings. The House speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had tested positive for Covid-19. The justice department blocked the House 6 January inquiry from accessing 15 boxes of Trump’s White House records, according to reports. One other issue to emerge from this afternoon’s White House press briefing: the Biden administration dismissed as “a publicity stunt” a declaration by the Texas governor Greg Abbott that he was going to bus undocumented migrants to Washington DC. Abbott floated the plan as his response to the upcoming termination of Title 42, a Trump-era immigration policy blocking migrants at the US southern border because of Covid-19. Critics of the administration, and the homeland security department, predict a surge of migrants when the program ends next month. “I’m not aware of any authority the governor would be doing that under,” Psaki said. “I think it’s pretty clear this is a publicity stunt, his own office admits that a migrant would need to voluntarily be transported and he can’t compel them to because enforcement of our country’s immigration government lies with the federal government, not a state.” Inevitably, questions in the White House briefing room turned to Covid-19 and the announcement earlier today that the House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was twice in Joe Biden’s close company without a mask in recent days, had tested positive. Psaki said the administration was not concerned for the 79-year-old president’s age because, under centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) guidelines, the two are not considered “close contacts.” “It’s not arbitrary. It’s not something made up by the White House,” Psaki said of the guidelines. “They define it as being within six feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutes over a 24 hour period that they were not. “In terms of additional testing or anything along those lines, those assessments would be made by the president’s doctor. He was tested last evening and tested negative. “We have incredibly stringent protocols at the White House that we keep in place to keep the president, to keep everybody safe. Those go over and above CDC guidelines, and that includes ensuring that anyone who is going to be around the president is tested.” Over at the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki has been answering questions about US arms shipments to Ukraine, given military leaders’ assessments that the war against Russia could take years. “There are transfers of systems nearly every single day,” Psaki said, hours after the Ukraine defense minister Dymtro Zulebi told journalists in Brussels that there were only three items on his country’s wish list for the US and its allies: “Weapons, weapons and weapons.” “For every Russian tank in Ukraine, the United States will have, or has provided, 10 anti-tank systems. For every Russian armored vehicle in Ukraine, the United States will have provided about three anti-armor systems, if you factor in contributions from allies,” Psaki said. “The way this works is that the Ukrainian leaders request a range of assistance, they often provide us lists, we go through that list, we determine what we can provide. We provide a vast, vast majority of what they’re requesting [and] if we don’t have access to it, sometimes it’s Russian-made military equipment, we work with our allies and partners to see what they can provide.” Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the US supreme court shatters several glass ceilings in America’s long struggle to form a more perfect union. Not only will she be the first Black woman to sit on the court since it assembled in 1790. She will also be the first justice with experience as a public defender to join a bench that has hosted many former prosecutors. When Jackson takes her seat on the nine-justice panel, following Stephen Breyer’s retirement probably in June, she will also raise its female contingent to four – a historic number that brings a majority of female justices within reach. On a more personal level, her promotion to the supreme court is the fulfillment of her ambition to excel at the law which she has nurtured from a young age. It is the realization of the promise given to her by her parents, who were themselves brought up under the ignominies of racial segregation in the US south. Read more here: Vice-president Kamala Harris, who oversaw the senate vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson, said she was “overjoyed” at the result. “I am feeling overjoyed and I am feeling a deep sense of pride in who we are as a nation,” Harris told reporters as she was leaving the chamber, according to NPR. The White House has announced that Harris will join President Joe Biden for a press conference on the South Lawn tomorrow at 12.15pm to talk about Jackson’s confirmation. Supreme court scholars are weighing in with analysis on the Jackson confirmation, calling her a “worthy successor” to the retiring liberal justice Stephen Breyer. “She possesses all of the attributes that the US expects of supreme court justices, she has substantial relevant experience as a judge at the district and appellate levels of the federal judiciary, is highly intelligent, diligent and independent, and enjoys balanced judicial temperament. She amply displayed all of these phenomena throughout three grueling days of questioning,” Carl Tobias, Williams chair in law at the University of Richmond said. “Her confirmation will enhance the supreme court and the nation in many critical ways. Of course, her appointment is historic, as she is the first Black woman to serve, she will improve court diversity in terms of ethnicity, gender, ideology and experience. “Jackson [also] promises to be a mainstream justice, which is important, because the Court is more ideologically conservative than it has been in the last 80 years and may not reflect the will of the people. Her diverse experiences are also critical, as Justice Sotomayor is the only justice who served as a district judge and no present justice has engaged in criminal defense work, which Jackson did and which improves her decision making.” Professor Tobias added he was hopeful Jackson’s torrid confirmation process would lead to improvements in how future supreme court justices are seated. “Many Americans, including members of the judiciary committee, believe that the confirmation process has been deteriorating. The process has become overly politicized and partisan and senators asked Jackson too many questions that lacked relevance, seemed calculated to score political points ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, or were even improper or insulting. “I am cautiously optimistic that committee members and other senators will work on improvements in the process, which now can reflect poorly on the committee, the Senate, and the president and may erode public confidence in all three branches of federal government, but especially the court.” ABC News has tweeted an image of Ketanji Brown Jackson hugging with President Joe Biden, taken at the White House at the moment her supreme court confirmation vote passed the majority threshold. Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation represents “a tremendously historic day at the White House and in the country,” according to Joe Biden’s press secretary Jen Psaki. Speaking at her afternoon press briefing, Psaki said Biden had remained engaged through the entire confirmation process, talking with senators on both sides of the political divide. “This is a fulfillment of a promise the president made to the country. His time on the judiciary committee was defining for him and gave him historically exceptional preparation for what we would consider a smooth process, characterized by heavy engagement with both parties in the senate,” Psaki said. “He promised to choose a successor in the mold of Justice [Stephen] Breyer as Republicans and Democrats called for and after thorough consideration chose Judge Jackson, or Justice Jackson I guess we can now call her. “The President’s outreach continued at this stage, calling senators in both parties early about his choice. Out of the gate, he proved he had chosen someone in the tradition by immediately getting endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police and Judge Thomas Griffith [Biden’s appointee to the presidential commission on the supreme court], followed by procession of leading conservative legal minds and additional law enforcement organizations.” In Ketanji Brown Jackson, “President Biden picked the most extraordinary individual that I could think of in America,” the Democratic chair of the Senate judiciary committee, Dick Durbin, has said. “She turned out to be a pillar of strength to show grace and dignity and really won over the hearts of the American people,” he told reporters after the confirmation vote. “We want to make our justice system look much more like America. And today we took a giant step forward in giving this judge, Ketanji Brown Jackson, her lifetime chance to serve on the United States supreme court.” The president of the national association for the advancement of colored people (NAACP) Derrick Johnson has welcomed Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the supreme court. “In 2022, the first Black woman will finally sit on America’s supreme court. It has taken far too long, but President Biden promised and delivered,” he said in a statement. “Former NAACP Chief Counsel Thurgood Marshall broke down the wall when he was nominated and confirmed as the first Black American to sit on the Supreme Court. Today, Ketanji Brown Jackson shattered the glass ceiling. “While history has been made today, the unjust hurdles Black women like Ketanji Brown Jackson face each and every day were centerstage throughout the hearing process. The racist attacks were disgusting and shameful, but, as Black women do, Ketanji Brown Jackson outshined the hate. Today and every day, we celebrate Black women. “The NAACP remains committed to tearing down the racist obstacles that continue to obstruct paths for far too many Americans, especially Black women, throughout our nation. While we celebrate today, tomorrow we are back at work tackling student debt, voting and reproductive rights, climate change, and police reform, so that everyone in America can realize their dream.” Finally, Rand Paul, unsurprisingly, makes his vote a no, making Ketanji Brown Jackson’s historic confirmation vote final at 53-47. “On this vote the yays are 53, the nays are 47, and this nomination is confirmed,” the vice-president Kamala Harris, said, acting in her role of Senate president. The chamber immediately erupted into cheers. The final vote tally for Ketanji Brown Jackson’s supreme court confirmation is not yet in. The Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul is, for reasons that are still unclear, yet to cast his vote. Regardless, Jackson’s confirmation is a done deal, with the tally standing at 53-46 in her favor. She will be sworn in sometime in late June or early July, when the liberal justice Stephen Breyer, whom she is replacing, retires from the bench. The US Senate has voted to confirm Joe Biden’s pick Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to a seat on the US supreme court. The historic vote makes her the first Black woman to sit on the nation’s highest court. Full story here: The Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer is giving his closing remarks ahead of the chamber’s vote on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s supreme court confirmation. “This is a wonderful day, a joyous day and an inspiring day for the Senate, the supreme court, and the United States of America,” he said. “It’s been a dark two years with Covid... but even in the darkest times there are bright lights. Today is one of the brightest lights. Let us hope it is a metaphor, an indication of many more bright lights. “Every step of her upbringing and career, Ketanji Brown Jackson ranked one of the highest achievers.” She will, he said, “enhance the court’s ability to preserve the basic truth in our country that all deserve equal justice under the law, from the privilege to the impoverished.” Schumer acknowledged that Jackson will become the first Black woman to sit on the panel. “This judge belongs on the supreme court. By that I mean something very specific. In our nation’s history, 115 individuals have been confirmed by this body to serve on the supreme court. Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first African American woman ever to hold the title. The kids will open textbooks and see pictures of Justice Jackson among the highest ranks.” New York’s attorney general Letitia James has asked a state judge to hold Donald Trump in contempt of court for refusing to turn over documents she subpoenaed for her civil investigation into the former US president’s business operations. In the court filing, James said Trump failed to abide by his earlier agreement to comply “in full” with her subpoena for documents and information by 31 March. James is seeking that Trump be fined $10,000 a day until he complies. Last week, James asked the appeals court to uphold a lower-court ruling requiring Trump to answer questions under oath, after a civil investigation uncovered evidence he may have misstated the value of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers on financial statements for more than a decade. “The evidence collected to date suggests that financial statements, tax submissions, loan guarantees, and other documents contain material misstatements and omissions,” James’s office said in court papers. James is also seeking to uphold a ruling forcing Trump’s two oldest children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr, to testify. Both have been executives at the Trump Organization. Here’s a handy explainer, courtesy of CNN, about how the supreme court confirmation process works. Essentially, Judge Ketanji Brown’s lifetime appointment to the bench will be confirmed by a simple majority vote of the 100 US senators in the chamber this afternoon. The US Senate is currently evenly split, between 50 Republicans, and the 48 Democrats and two independents who usually vote with them. In the event of a 50-50 tie in the Senate confirmation vote, the Democratic vice-president Kamala Harris would be called upon to break the tie and promote Jackson to the supreme court. Three Republicans, however, and two at least two moderate Democrats whose votes might have been in the balance, have publicly declared their support for Jackson. So, even if there are no more defections, Harris’s intervention will not be necessary, and the vote for Jackson would be at least 53-47 in her favor. That’s the same margin that senators voted in the last hour to end discussion on Jackson’s nomination and advance the process to the final Senate floor vote. Assuming she is confirmed, Jackson will be seated later this summer, when the liberal justice Stephen Breyer, whose retirement led to Joe Biden nominating Jackson for his seat, stands down after 22 years’ service. Supreme court: key preliminary vote passes to limit debate in Senate The Senate has now voted 53 to 47 to limit debate on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the supreme court. The cloture vote is a key part of the process with the final confirmation vote expected later Thursday in the early afternoon in Washington DC. “No one can argue that Justice Brown Jackson is not qualified to be confirmed,” said Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, in the chamber just after the vote. “Judge Jackson has earned the president’s nomination, and has earned confirmation from the Senate.” He criticized the way Republicans conducted themselves in the nomination hearings. Shortly earlier he tweeted that it was a day to “make history”. She left it late, but the Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate Democrat, has just announced she will vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court. News of Sinema’s potential vote has been closely watched. Along with fellow moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the two have combined to derail several of Joe Biden’s policy goals in the US Senate this term. Manchin declared his intention to support Jackson last week, and with at least three Republicans on board, Sinema’s vote was not in the end crucial - although it would have been a surprise for her to have voted no. A cloture vote to end Senate debate on Jackson’s nomination is due imminently, and the final confirmation vote is scheduled for about 1.45pm. The House speaker Nancy Pelosi has tested positive for Covid-19, her office has just announced. A statement from the Speaker’s spokesperson Drew Hammill reads: After testing negative this week, Speaker Pelosi received a positive test result for Covid-19 and is currently asymptomatic. The Speaker is fully vaccinated and boosted, and is thankful for the robust protection the vaccine has provided. The Speaker will quarantine consistent with CDC guidance, and encourages everyone to get vaccinated, boosted and test regularly.” Pelosi, 82, was with president Joe Biden, and the former president Barack Obama, at the White House on Tuesday as he signed an executive order extending the affordable care act. Few of the attendees were masked. She was with Biden again yesterday at the White House when the president signed the postal services act. The White House press secretary Jen Psaki is certain to be asked about it at her lunchtime briefing today. Obama has recently recovered from Covid-19. Pelosi was not an attendee at the Gridiron dinner in Washington DC on Saturday, following which several Biden administration officials tested positive, including the US attorney general Merrick Garland and commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, as well as Democratic congressmen Adam Schiff and Joaquin Castro. The justice department is blocking the 6 January House investigation from accessing more than a dozen boxes of records from the Trump White House, CNN is reporting, fueling speculation they are the subject of its own criminal inquiry. According to the network, National Archives general counsel Gary Stern wrote to the House oversight committee saying it was unable to respond to a request for information from the panel about the records based on the Archives’ “consultation” with the justice department. The bipartisan panel is looking into Trump’s efforts to overturn his election defeat, including his incitement of the deadly 6 January Capitol attack. The 15 boxes of records in question are those Trump is said to have taken with him to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, in January 2021 when he left office, in apparent violation of federal records laws. The development is a bump for the House panel, which has made significant headway in recent weeks as it attempts to establish Trump’s culpability. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, and her husband Jared Kushner, both former White House advisers, have given testimony in the past few days. The justice department, and the US attorney general Merrick Garland, have come under fire for perceived slow progress in its own inquiry. CNN said the justice department had declined to comment, but that it was common practice to limit information that government agencies share with Congress while an investigation is ongoing. On Wednesday, the House voted to hold former Trump advisers Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro in contempt for refusing subpoenas to testify to the panel.

The conversions are “a warning sign” for Democrats as they attempt to keep control of Congress in November’s midterm elections, the Reuters report states. Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state that backed Joe Biden narrowly in 2020, is likely to see a furious scramble for one of its Senate seats with the retirement of Pat Toomey, the only statewide elected Republican. “I just got fed up and just felt like there has to be a better way,” Beth Jones, 48, a retired Philadelphia police officer who last month registered as a Republican, told Reuters, citing crime and high inflation for her decision. Jones said she had voted Democratic for three decades. Reuters said it examined registration data in six states that could see tight US Senate races in November and which generally require voters to be members of a party to participate in nominating contests. While each state tracks voter registration differently, the review pointed to Republican gains in four of those states, and no substantial difference in two of them. In Pennsylvania, Republicans have converted four Democrats for every Republican who has switched the other way, according to the Pennsylvania’s state department data. The conversion rate is well above 2016, Reuters says, when Republicans took the White House, House of Representatives and Senate. A bipartisan group of senators wants Joe Biden to reverse the decision to end the Trump-era immigration policy that blocked refugees at the US southern border because of the coronavirus pandemic. Axios is reporting that the group of five Democratic and six Republican senators will introduce a bill later today that would prevent the Biden administration from lifting Title 42 without a detailed plan in place to stop an expected surge of migrants at the border. “It is evident that the current preparations and plans for the end of Title 42 aren’t adequate,” Axios quoted the bill’s co-sponsor, the Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, stating she met with the homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday. The Biden administration announced last week that the policy introduced by Trump in 2020 would end on 23 May, painting it as a public health move because the pandemic was easing. But the announcement has received massive pushback, and threatens to derail negotiations in Congress over a relief package for vaccines, treatments and testing, the Washington Post reported. The White House wanted $22.5bn, and a bipartisan panel of senators appeared to have settled on $10bn, before the Title 42 prompted a furious reaction from Republicans. Adding to the acrimony, the Texas governor Greg Abbott says he’s going to round up busloads of undocumented immigrants and send them to Washington DC for Joe Biden to deal with, according to CNN. Read about the impact of the Title 42 decision here: Big cities in California spent large portions of their federal Covid relief money on police departments, a review of public records has revealed, with several cities prioritizing police funding by a wide margin. As part of the American Rescue Plan Act (Arpa), the Biden administration’s signature stimulus package, the US government sent funds to cities to help them fight coronavirus and support local recovery efforts. The money, officials said, could be used to fund a range of services, including public health and housing initiatives, healthcare workers’ salaries, infrastructure investments and aid for small businesses. But most large California cities spent millions of Arpa dollars on law enforcement. Some also gave police money from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (Cares) Act, adopted in 2020 under Donald Trump. In a state with severe income inequality and a dramatically worsening homelessness crisis, the stimulus spending has sparked backlash from community organizers who argue that the funds should have gone directly to civilians and that police should have accepted cuts. “It was called the ‘American Rescue Plan’, but you’re telling me that what needed to be rescued was the police department?” said Stephen “Cue” Jn-Marie, a pastor and activist at Skid Row in LA. “The city’s kneejerk reaction is always to use law enforcement to respond to everything … and the police forces keep getting larger.” Read the full story here: The Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has scheduled a 1.45pm vote for the confirmation of Joe Biden’s pick Ketanji Brown Jackson to be confirmed as the first Black female associate justice of the US Supreme Court. In a tweet, Schumer said: “It will be a joyous day for America!” Despite a fractious and sometimes farcical hearing in the House two weeks ago, and the announcement of high-profile Republican senator Lindsey Graham that he wouldn’t support her now (despite voting for her earlier elevation to the US appeals court), her confirmation is all but certain. Three Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have announced they will vote for her, assuring Biden of a prized bipartisan appointment in the equally divided chamber. Jackson’s elevation to the nation’s highest court, replacing the long-serving liberal justice Stephen Breyer, who is retiring, is more than just symbolic. The lifetime appointment at the age of 51 could see Jackson on the bench for decades, and she will likely prove a vocal counter to the panel’s current 6-3 conservative majority. The Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate judiciary, praised Jackson’s “impeccable qualifications” on Monday, and said her experience as a public defender would bring a “missing perspective to the court”. “Hers is a uniquely American family story, how much hope and promise can be achieved in just one generation,” Durbin said. “I’m proud we can bear witness to it.” Jackson will become only the sixth woman to sit on the Supreme Court in its more than 200-year history. Read the highlights of Jackson’s confirmation hearings here: Good morning blog readers, and welcome to what will be a busy Thursday. It’s a big day at the US supreme court, where Joe Biden’s pick Ketanji Brown Jackson is almost certain to be confirmed as its newest associate justice in a Senate vote scheduled for 1.45pm.

‘So much joy’: Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation lauded as ray of hope,2022-04-07T19:41:21Z,David Smith in Washington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pze,"Politicians and activists kept coming back to one word on Thursday after the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court: joy. After two grim years of a deadly pandemic and a democracy in peril, Jackson’s ascent as the first Black woman to serve on the nation’s highest court was lauded as a much-needed ray of hope. “Judge Jackson’s confirmation was a historic moment for our nation,” tweeted Joe Biden, posting a photo of himself with Jackson after they watched the Senate’s 53-47 bipartisan vote on TV. “We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America. She will be an incredible justice, and I was honored to share this moment with her.” Democratic senators stood and applauded in celebration. Cory Booker, a member of the Senate judiciary committee who is African American, said in a statement: “Like many Americans, I feel immense pride and so much joy at this historic occasion. “As Judge Jackson ascends to the United States supreme court, I see in her the affirmation of our ancestors who suffered the indignities of this country yet sacrificed to bend the moral arc of our nation towards justice. They knew that America, though haunted by its past failings, was not bound by them and believed that a day like this would eventually arrive.” The sentiment was echoed by Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She said: “This is truly a joyful day for the country. Judge Jackson is one of the most experienced nominees in decades.” Jayapal acknowledged the partisan attacks by Republicans during Jackson’s confirmation process, including misleading questions about her sentencing of child abuse images offenders and views on critical race theory. “The country saw her poise, grace, thoughtfulness, and brilliance as she handled every part of the confirmation process – including some outrageous attacks from Republican senators that damaged only their credibility, not hers,” she added. Jackson’s status as the first African American female justice in the 233-year history of the supreme court was also hailed by civil rights organisations, which pointed to its symbolic power for future generations of Black girls who will see her in school textbooks. Janette McCarthy Wallace, general counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said: “Today, Black women truly are supreme. Over the past few weeks, it has been an incredible privilege to bear witness to the rise of the first Black woman supreme court justice. “The significance of this moment for the Black community, especially for Black women like me who have spent decades in the legal profession, is tough to overstate.” Wallace added: “Representation is powerful – now, Black women and girls who dream of reaching the highest levels of our government can see that it is possible. While soon-to-be Justice Jackson’s confirmation did not come without racist, misogynistic attacks on her career and character, it is without question that Ketanji Brown Jackson is eminently qualified to serve on the supreme court of the United States.” Amanda Brown Lierman, executive director of Supermajority, a women’s equality organisation, added: “This is a historic moment for all women, but especially for women of color. Representation matters, and little Black girls everywhere will finally be able to see themselves represented on the highest court of the land. “I could not be more proud to have Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on the bench. I will be celebrating her with my three daughters today, and every April 7 will be Ketanji Brown Jackson day in our house.” Republicans were unrepentant about their opposition to Jackson. Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican national committee, said: “Biden’s pick Ketanji Brown Jackson is a radical, activist judge, one who failed to answer simple questions on her record, including leniency for child porn offenders and support of CRT. “Jackson has proved to be in lockstep with the far left’s political agenda, even refusing to define what a woman is.” But the vote represents a rare victory for progressives after years of setbacks and bitterly divisive hearings that saw conservatives on the court gain a 6-3 majority that will remain unchanged. Barack Obama, America’s first Black president, tweeted congratulations to Jackson and wrote: “This is a great day for America, and a proud moment in our history.” Meagan Hatcher-Mays, director of democracy policy for the grassroots movement Indivisible, said: “It’s not often we can describe a Senate vote as ‘joyous’, but that’s exactly what this was – for the first time in the supreme court’s 233-year history, a Black woman will serve as a justice.”"

"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",2022-04-07T20:00:02Z,Nino Bucci,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y6yty,"Northern Territory police officer Zachary Rolfe spoke repeatedly about how he could take a paid holiday if he shot someone while on duty, his former fiancee told detectives, according to a transcript of a police interview and a statement released by the NT supreme court. In the wide-ranging interview the woman also said Rolfe told her at different times that he was the first to get his gun out on jobs, and did not turn on his body-worn camera as he did not want people at the police station to see what he was doing. In response to questions from the Guardian, Rolfe has strongly denied making any of the comments, and questioned why his former fiancee, who was also a police officer, did not mention them to her superiors or colleagues at the time. The NT supreme court has released a transcript of the woman’s interview and statement following Rolfe’s acquittal in March on charges of murder and two alternative charges regarding the death of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi Walker. Walker had been shot three times by Rolfe during an arrest in the remote community of Yuendumu, 300km north-west of Alice Springs, in November 2019. Rolfe argued at trial that he shot Walker in defence of himself and a colleague after Walker stabbed him with scissors and struggled with another officer. Guardian Australia does not suggest that the matters raised in the interview and the statement had any bearing on Rolfe’s actions in respect of the death of Kumanjayi Walker or his acquittal by a jury in the subsequent criminal trial. However, as remarks alleged to have been made by a serving police officer, and included in documents put before the court, the Guardian considers there is a public interest in reporting the claims. The woman, who Guardian Australia has chosen not to name, said she started her relationship with Rolfe in early 2018 when the pair both worked at Alice Springs police station. They became engaged within weeks, before Rolfe broke up with her later that year. She said she left the force soon after the separation, and had not spoken to Rolfe for almost a year before the shooting. In August 2020, Det Sen Sgt Kirk Pennuto and Det Sgt Wayne Newell, the officers investigating Walker’s death, interviewed the 26-year-old woman for almost two-and-a-half hours. A year later, in September 2021, the woman made a further brief statement clarifying information she had previously provided. The 92-page transcript of the August interview, along with the later statement, was included in a bundle of material tendered by the prosecution in a pre-trial application to determine what was admissible in Rolfe’s trial. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In that application, the prosecution relied on limited sections of the transcript and statement, largely concerning what Rolfe had allegedly said regarding a previous arrest. The remainder of the transcript, including the alleged statements in this story, was not raised and was not the subject of submissions. Rolfe’s defence team successfully argued none of the material was admissible as evidence, in part because no findings of wrongdoing had been made against Rolfe. Justice John Burns ultimately found that including the material would not help a jury determine whether Rolfe was guilty of the murder of Walker. “Nothing in the evidence of the tendency incidents could … assist the jury in understanding or inferring the accused’s state of mind of the charged events,” Justice Burns said in a January 2022 decision. As a result, evidence about the matters in the transcript was not presented at trial and Rolfe did not have an opportunity to answer it. The interview contains details about how Rolfe’s former fiancee viewed his relationships with policing, the army, and his colleagues. While much of it details her impressions and opinions, it also includes her account of several statements she alleges Rolfe made to her. “Zach said on several occasions to me … that he would like to shoot someone so then he can go on a paid holiday,” she said in the interview. In her later statement, she said Rolfe said words to the effect of “if I shot someone I could go on a six-month holiday”. She said in the police interview: “Because obviously when you shoot someone you go under investigation, like what is happening now, and you go on a paid holiday. “I don’t think he really understood the ramifications of if that ever actually did happen or would happen. And then it did happen. And I couldn’t imagine he’s in a good position now.” Asked later in the interview whether she took Rolfe to be serious she said: “Mm yeah. Because he said it so many times. I think he really did – I think everything is said in like, said in jest is like, oh, it would be a paid holiday, but then when it really happens, is it really a fun paid holiday, like is it really not that serious?” Asked again whether the comments were made flippantly she said “I think some were considered and some were flippant. ’Cause you have to consider something to say something on several occasions.” She said she believed Rolfe had made similar comments on “maybe” five occasions, and that she had responded that it would not be a “fun holiday at all”. In her later statement, she said this occurred when they were talking about going on a holiday and Rolfe would say it off the cuff. It happened several times during conversations at the home they shared in Alice Springs, she said. In a statement to the Guardian, Rolfe strongly denied making any of the alleged comments in this story. He did not respond to individual questions, but raised the fact his ex-fiancee had not reported those comments at the time. “I strongly deny making any of these alleged comments. During our relationship, despite the seriousness of her allegations, she never mentioned them to her superiors or fellow police officers. “Despite me being such an apparently bad guy, [she] stayed with me until I broke off the relationship with her in 2018 and was devastated when I did so.” When asked by Pennuto during her interview why she had not “done anything” with the comments she said Rolfe made to her about a paid holiday, the former fiancee responded: “I don’t know … I loved him at the time and I just – I would say to him, ‘you don’t want to go on that kind of holiday, it’s not a holiday, it’s serious,’ and then he would just like kind of laugh it off. “So I think I, in myself, tried to tell myself that it was – it wasn’t real, like he didn’t actually mean that sort of thing. But there’s no other reason, like I can’t think of why I didn’t tell anyone.” Rolfe and the woman met in late 2017 and were engaged in March 2018, she told police. They separated about six months later. She said they had been planning a wedding before he broke up with her. Pennuto and Newell asked the woman extensive questions about Rolfe’s conduct as a police officer. The woman also told police during her interview that Rolfe had said to her – she believed when he was teaching her to shoot at a range – that he would always be the first person to get his gun out if required on a job. She said in her later signed statement that Rolfe had said to her at the home they shared “I always get my gun out first”, and that he had thought it was funny in the context he was saying it. He also told her, she said, that he did not turn on his body-worn camera, because he did not want people at the station to see what he had been doing. Rolfe’s camera was on during the shooting of Walker, and throughout his time in Yuendumu, with portions of the footage played during his trial. Rolfe’s former fiancee also told police that the “awful” and “terrible” culture at Alice Springs police station generally of “bitching” behind people’s backs was so bad that she ended up leaving the force. In December last year, the prosecution in Rolfe’s murder case made an unsuccessful application to include material relating to his alleged history in policing, known as tendency evidence, in his trial. The prosecution sought to include evidence regarding four incidents in which they alleged Rolfe may have improperly used force while he was involved in an arrest. But his lawyers argued in a pre-trial hearing that on all four occasions Rolfe had been cleared of using inappropriate force, and there had not been any finding of wrongdoing against him during his career. Justice Burns said during the hearing that the prosecution appeared to have “cherrypicked” four arrests from potentially hundreds of others in which Rolfe had been involved without incident. Most of the former fiancee’s interview and statement was not referred to in this application, but her claims relating to the arrest of a man called Malcolm Ryder were referred to by the prosecution as something they would seek to rely on to establish what they alleged was a pattern of behaviour by Rolfe. She said in her interview that Rolfe told her he had asked a colleague at Alice Springs police station to scratch his face after he arrested Ryder in 2018. She said Rolfe wanted to make it appear that Ryder had scratched him during the arrest to justify his use of force. She and Rolfe were not dating at the time of the Ryder incident and she said in her statement that Rolfe told her this later. Ryder was cleared of charges of assaulting police. The fiancee’s claims did not form part of that trial. Rolfe’s lawyer, Luke Officer, said in a statement to the Guardian that it was important to note that so little of the former fiancee’s interview was used in the prosecution’s application. He said the portions referred to in this article were not raised in the application and the transcript and allegations in it were not raised at trial. “If you chose to publish certain extracts of the transcript that were not relied upon by the prosecution and rejected by the trial judge in a failed application to introduce tendency evidence then in our view that is not fair, accurate and balanced.” The transcript of the interview and other materials were released to the media just over two weeks ago after the Guardian and other outlets successfully argued for the lifting of about 20 suppression orders on the case. The woman also gave a second interview to police, but the transcript of this interview was not included in the prosecution’s evidence. During the court hearing determining whether the orders should be lifted, David Edwardson, QC for Rolfe, argued that the tendency evidence was “misconceived” and that suppression orders regarding it should therefore remain in place. He said the tendency material was “no more than an argument that was advanced by the prosecution, unsuccessfully, as to conduct imputed against Mr Rolfe”. “It was inadmissible. It’s unsubstantiated. And there is no public interest, in my submission, in it being put out into the ether, so to speak. “So that’s the basis upon which we maintain our objection.” But Justice Burns said the public interest in open justice and scrutiny of the court’s decisions outweighed any potential damage to Rolfe’s reputation. “Whichever way one looks at the matter, while there may be some embarrassment and potentially some damage to the reputation of Mr Rolfe if the material which is the subject of the suppression orders is published, that is of lesser importance … than ensuring that the public has the means of scrutinising the decisions which have been made by this court and of understanding the decisions that the court has made,” he said. “In my view, it is in the public interest that the decisions made by the court surrounding the evidence which the Crown sought to lead at trial and which was rejected be subject to open scrutiny. “This is particularly so in a case where there are post-trial claims made of interference in the charging process.” Michael Riches, the NT independent commissioner against corruption, announced on 29 March that he was investigating “allegations of improper conduct relating to the arrest and charge” of Rolfe in relation to Walker’s death. The NT police have said they will fully cooperate with the investigation."
"Union rejects pay rise of £1,500 for BT staff and plans strike ballot",2022-04-07T12:17:55Z,Mark Sweney and Sarah Butler,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zeg,"BT has given 58,000 workers a £1,500 pay rise that it says is its biggest award in two decades, despite its largest union rejecting the deal and saying it intends to ballot members over strike action. Last week BT had a £1,200 pay rise offer rejected by the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents about 40,000 of the company’s 100,000 employees, with union bosses describing it as “insulting” and a “relative pay cut” as soaring inflation fuels a cost of living crisis. The CWU has been pushing for a 10% rise at BT in the face of rampant inflation, currently at 6.2%, which the Bank of England forecast could peak at 10% by the end of the year. On Thursday, the union rejected the improved award and said that it would now immediately prepare for a statutory industrial action ballot. BT said the flat-rate pay rise – mostly benefiting its lowest-paid staff – worked out as a rise of between 3% and 8%. It has been backdated to 1 April to coincide with households being hit by multiple price increases, from council tax and VAT on hospitality to broadband and phone bills, and will cost BT about £90m. “While we have continued to extend and strengthen our networks to support the country’s recovery, the pandemic has hit our financial performance, like that of most companies,” said Philip Jansen, the chief executive of BT. “We know that the cost of living continues to rise and by making this award we’re ensuring that our lower-paid workers will benefit most and as soon as possible.” Companies across the UK are holding talks over pay amid rising inflation. On Thursday the supermarket Tesco announced the second pay rise for shop and warehouse workers in a year. On Friday, Sainsbury’s is expected to raise pay for workers in its supermarkets and Argos stores in outer London by 55p an hour so that they will receive the London living wage of £11.05. The improvement makes Sainsbury’s the first supermarket group to pay all its workers above the independently verified living wage after pressure from investors. Sainsbury’s staff in inner London already receive £11.05 an hour after a pay rise last month while those outside the capital receive at least £10 an hour, slightly above the living wage target. The staff receiving the pay rise at BT are mainly those who work at its retail stores, engineers who work at its Openreach subsidiary, and call centre employees, all of whom are based in the UK. BT said talks with Prospect, the union that represents manager-level staff among the 42,000 who have not received a pay award, would commence soon. About 83,000 of BT’s total 100,000 workforce are based in the UK. Last year BT awarded 59,000 frontline workers a special bonus of £1,500 in recognition of their work during the coronavirus pandemic. This comprised a £1,000 cash bonus and £500 in shares, which will be awarded after three years as part of the employee share scheme. The bonus award cost BT about £110m, and the company said the payments represented about 5% of the average employee’s salary. Tesco said on Thursday it was investing £200m to raise its minimum hourly rate of pay by 5.8% to £10.10 from 24 July 2022, the biggest single-year investment in hourly pay for shop and warehouse workers at the UK’s largest supermarket chain in at least a decade. Under the deal agreed with the Usdaw union, some shopping delivery drivers, who currently receive £9.55 an hour, will receive an extra 90p an hour from 1 May, taking their hourly rate to £11.00 from 24 July 2022. The latest pay rise at Tesco comes only seven months after it increased wages for its lowest-paid workers by 2.7% to £9.55 an hour. The new deal has been agreed after Tesco became the lowest-paying supermarket in the UK, with Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl all offering £10 an hour or more, while Asda began paying £9.66 an hour from this month. Businesses are being forced to push through significant pay increases as workers struggle with heavy inflation on the cost of living, and there is heavy competition for suitable staff."
Ketanji Brown Jackson makes history as first Black woman confirmed to US supreme court,2022-04-07T18:01:26Z,Lauren Gambino and Joan E Greve in Washington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7knj,"Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal appeals court judge, was confirmed to the supreme court on Thursday, overcoming a rancorous Senate approval process and earning bipartisan approval to become the first Black woman to serve as a justice on the high court in its more than 200-year history. After weeks of private meetings and days of public testimony, marked by intense sparring over judicial philosophy and personal reflections on race in America, Jackson earned narrow – but notable – bipartisan support to become the 116th justice of the supreme court. The vote was 53 to 47, with all Democrats in favor. They were joined by three moderate Republicans, senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who defied deep opposition within their party to support Joe Biden’s nominee. Their support was a welcome result for the White House, which had been intent on securing a bipartisan confirmation. Jackson, who currently serves on the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, will replace Stephen Breyer, 83, the most senior member of the court’s liberal bloc. Breyer, for whom Jackson clerked early in her legal career, said he intends to retire from the court this summer. At 51, Jackson is young enough to serve on the court for decades. Her ascension, however, will do little to tilt the ideological balance of the high court, dominated by a 6-3 conservative majority. But it does mean for the first time in the court’s history that white men are in the minority. Kamala Harris, the first Black woman to serve as US vice-president, presided over the Senate vote as Jackson became the first Black woman to join the supreme court, underscoring the historic nature of her confirmation. Harris called for the final vote on Jackson’s nomination with a smile on her face, and the chamber broke into loud applause when the judge was confirmed. “Today, we are taking a giant, bold and important step on the well-trodden path to fulfilling our country’s founding promises,” Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said just before the final vote. “This is a great moment for Judge Jackson. But it is an even greater moment for America as we rise to a more perfect union.” The White House has announced that Biden, Harris and Jackson will deliver remarks on Friday to celebrate the confirmation. Jackson and Biden watched the final Senate vote together in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. Biden shared a photo taken with Jackson at the White House, saying on Twitter: “Judge Jackson’s confirmation was a historic moment for our nation. We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America. She will be an incredible justice, and I was honored to share this moment with her.” Assailing Jackson’s record, but acknowledging Republicans did not have the votes to stop her confirmation, minority leader Mitch McConnell implored the judge to embrace the textualist approach of conservative justices. “The soon-to-be justice can either satisfy her radical fan club or help preserve the judiciary that Americans need, but not both,” McConnell said ahead of the vote on Thursday. “I’m afraid the nominee’s record tells us which is likely, but I hope judge Jackson proves me wrong.” Her confirmation to the lifetime post represents the fulfillment of a promise Biden made to his supporters at the nadir of his 2020 campaign for president, when he vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the supreme court, if elected president and a vacancy arose. The opportunity presented itself earlier this year, at another low point for Biden, with momentous domestic and foreign challenges weighing on his presidency. During the public hearings, Jackson vowed to be an independent justice who would seek to ensure that the words inscribed on the marbled supreme court building – Equal Justice Under the Law – were a “reality and not just an ideal”. With her parents and daughters present, Jackson recounted for the Senate judiciary committee her family’s generational journey, as the daughter of public school teachers raised in the segregated south who would rise to become a justice on a court that once denied Black Americans citizenship. Yet any hope by the White House that Jackson’s historic nomination might defuse some of the bitter partisanship that senators lament has turned the process into a “circus” quickly evaporated. With an eye to the November midterm elections, Republicans led an aggressive campaign against the judge during her confirmation hearings and in conservative media, raising questions about her record in an effort to paint her as an “activist judge” who is soft on crime. They used the confirmation proceedings to air conservative grievances about past supreme court nominations and to wage culture war battles over critical race theory, crime and transgender women in sports. Couched in thinly coded appeals to racism and the far-right fringes with nods to the QAnon conspiracy theory, some Republicans accused Jackson of being too lenient on child sexual abuse offenders, claims she forcefully rebutted “as a mother and a judge”. Legal experts have said her decisions in such criminal cases were within the mainstream while independent factcheckers concluded that the attacks were misleading and a distortion of her record. Democrats, and the handful of Republicans who supported her, praised her qualifications and demeanor, and in particular the restraint she showed during some stinging exchanges with conservative senators. They sought to defend her record, noting that her sentencing record was within the mainstream of the federal judiciary, while emphasizing the support she had earned from within the legal community, including among conservative justices, and her endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police, which cited her family’s law enforcement background. In a mark of just how polarizing the process of confirming a supreme court nominee has become, the Senate judiciary committee deadlocked along party lines over her nomination. The resulting tie prompted Democrats to execute a rare procedural maneuver to “discharge” her nomination from the committee to the floor, with a vote by the full Senate. The NAACP said the vote by 11 Republicans against Jackson’s nomination was a “stain” on the committee. The final Senate vote on her confirmation was among the closest in supreme court history.

Leaked emails reveal Manchester City received payments from Abu Dhabi,2022-04-07T19:28:53Z,Paul MacInnes,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7q2x,"Emails have been released that appear to show the state of Abu Dhabi facilitating payments to Manchester City, reigniting the controversy that led to the club receiving a ban from European competition that was ultimately overturned at the court of arbitration for sport. According to documents published by Der Spiegel, City liaised with a government agency in the Gulf State to fulfil payments to the club owed by a private company under the control of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family and City’s owner since 2008. It comes alongside further claims that the Premier League is investigating the possibility City paid transfer fees for underage players and supplemented the wages of their former manager, Roberto Mancini, by means of a secret consultancy contract. City would not comment on the allegations but sources close to the club said the new reports were a continuation of an “orchestrated campaign” and part of “an endless attempt to damage us”. Previous allegations made by Der Spiegel which suggested City were the beneficiaries of inflated sponsorship deals directly funded by Sheikh Mansour led to the club receiving a two-year ban from the Champions League. That ban was subsequently cancelled on appeal by Cas. The new reports are based in part on a further tranche of documents released by the Football Leaks group. They show a number of communications between Simon Pearce, a member of the City board and vice-chairman of sister club Melbourne City FC, and Omar Awad, the finance director of the Executive Affairs Authority, an Abu Dhabi government agency. In one email from 2013, Pearce is shown to ask Awad to forward a payment of £31.7m to City from a bank account belonging to the Abu Dhabi Investment and Development Group (ADUG). This is a fund owned by Sheikh Mansour but which UAE officials have consistently said is a private fund and unconnected to the state. Further club communications published by Der Spiegel but previously reported on by Reuters show Pearce communicating from an EEA.gov.ae email address. One such mail is sent to Pearce from City’s then head of finance Andrew Widdowson on 7 December 2012 and asks for Pearce to “help in facilitating the amounts due via the Abu Dhabi partners”. Widdowson then goes on to specify sums of money to be directed through sponsors Etihad and Etisalat, two Abu Dhabi businesses. “I want to ensure that they come through the correct channels and are not picked up as separate sources of funding,” Widdowson writes. Der Spiegel also reports that the Premier League is continuing to investigate City after nearly three years, in what the magazine claims is a three-pronged pursuit. Alongside questions over the involvement of the Abu Dhabi state in making payments to City, the Premier League are also reported to be looking into claims City recruited the then 14-year-old player Brahim Díaz, contrary to Fifa’s rules over the movement of minors. Der Spiegel claims that ADUG also paid €360,000 in compensation to Díaz’s youth team, indirectly via Spanish intermediaries. The Premier League are further reported to be investigating claims that were also part of the Football Leaks files, which appear to show that former manager Mancini both received a salary from City and a larger annual “consultancy” fee from Al Jazira Club, a group controlled by Sheikh Mansour. The supplementary fee was allegedly devised in order to circumvent Uefa’s Financial Fair Play rules. The Premier League would not comment on the Der Spiegel allegations, nor the investigation into City which was confirmed as ongoing in a ruling by the court of appeal last year. In a statement released in 2019, the Premier League said it would not comment on the investigation further."
"The wealth of Akshata Murty, Indian heiress and wife of Rishi Sunak",2022-04-07T19:01:46Z,Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z4x,"Akshata Murthy is richer than the Queen and owns almost as many houses. The Indian heiress, and her husband, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, own a property portfolio of four homes worth an estimated £15m – including an LA penthouse overlooking the beach where Baywatch was filmed. The couple, who married in a lavish two-day Indian ceremony in 2009 and have two children, live predominantly in a flat above 10 Downing Street but also own two other properties in the capital and a £2m Grade II-listed Georgian mansion in Yorkshire. Murty, 42, is sitting on an estimated £690m fortune held in shares in Infosys, the IT giant founded by her billionaire father. That makes her much richer than the Queen, who has about £365m. It was revealed this week that despite living in the UK for the past nine years, Murty claims non-domicile status, allowing her to avoid paying UK tax on the £11.5m-a-year she collects in dividend from the overseas IT fortune. Using the “non-dom” scheme – which is also used by the now-sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and the Daily Mail owner, Lord Rothermere – has allowed Murty to not pay up an estimated £20m in tax that would have been due on £54m of dividends earned over the past seven-and-a-half years if she decided to pay UK tax in full. Her spokesperson suggested that Murty, as an Indian citizen, had no choice but to be “treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”. However, all UK residents must actively apply for non-dom status by filing in government tax form SA109 to claim the tax relief. Murty is also paying a £30,000 “annual charge” to the Treasury for the right to maintain her non-dom status beyond a seven-year cut off period. The non-domicile scheme, first introduced under King George III in 1799, is legal and can be used to avoid paying UK tax on income from overseas rents and bank interest as well as foreign dividends and inheritance tax. Non-doms can live in the UK all year round. The UK’s tax rules are set by Murty’s husband, the chancellor. In his spring statement last month, Sunak raised the tax burden on UK taxpayers to its highest level since the 1940s, even as the population faces the biggest squeeze on living standards on record. The Resolution Foundation thinktank suggested Sunak’s package of measures would push 1.3 million people, including 500,000 children, into poverty. Before they moved into Downing Street – when Sunak was appointed chancellor in 2020 – their main residence was a five-bedroom mews house in Kensington. The property, which they bought in 2010 for a reported £4.5m, is now estimated by estate agents to be worth more than £7m. They also own a flat on the nearby Old Brompton Road, which is said to be used by family and friends when they come to visit. In the picturesque North Yorkshire village of Kirby Sigston, the couple own a Grade II-listed Georgian manor house estimated to be worth £2m. The house, which they bought for £1.5m before Sunak became MP for the Richmond (Yorks) constituency, is undergoing a £250,000 development to add an indoor swimming pool, hot tub, tennis club and gym complex. Both Murty and Sunak are fitness fanatics, who have spoken of dawn workouts before work every day. The couple were last year granted planning permission for a single storey L-shaped building in a paddock beside the lake at their Yorkshire home set in 12 acres near Northallerton. The building project includes a 40ft by 16ft indoor pool, changing area, hot tub and dance room with a mirrored wall. The building is to be clad with local stone and topped with a Welsh slate roof to make it appear like “a stone-built ancillary building that has undergone renovation and modification”. However at the planning meeting last year, the councillor John Noone said: “It doesn’t look like an agricultural building to me, it looks like a rather large bungalow. I think it does actually have an impact on the setting of the Grade II manor house. When we went on the site visit you could clearly see the manor house from where we were stood.” In California, where Murty and Sunak met, she owns a $7.2m (£5.5m) penthouse apartment that boasts sweeping views of the world-famous Santa Monica pier and the Pacific Ocean beyond. Estate agents for the six-storey building, built in 2013, boast that the penthouse comes with “large private outdoor terraces unlike anything ever seen before on Ocean Avenue”. Residents of the Waverly complex on Ocean Avenue are promised “the epitome of urban Santa Monica beach living” with “stunning views of the Santa Monica mountain”, where you “wake up to the sound of waves crashing against the shore”. The building, designed by KTGY architects and with interiors by the LA designers Marmol Radziner, offers an around-the-clock concierge and a fitness centre “stocked with the latest equipment for those looking to improve their cardiovascular or muscular endurance”. There is even a “pet spa” where residents’ “furry companions can get pampered”. Murty, who was born in India, spent most of her late-teens and 20s in LA. She went to the city’s private liberal Claremont McKenna College, where she studied economics and French, before moving to the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. She worked for Deloitte and Unilever before studying for an MBA at Stanford University. It was at Stanford that she met Sunak, who had won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship. Within four years, they were married in a two-day ceremony in Bengaluru, attended by cricketing royalty including the Indian spinner Anil Kumble and the family of Rahul Dravid, the former captain of the national cricket team. Her father, NR Narayana Murthy, the billionaire founder of Infosys, said he was a “little sad and jealous” when Akshata first told him of her new life partner. “But when I met Rishi and found him to be all that you had described him to be – brilliant, handsome and, most importantly, honest – I understood why you let your heart be stolen.” As well as the Infosys stake, the couple also own London-based Catamaran Ventures UK, which invests in startups “with the view to future capital growth and income distributions”. Sunak transferred his shares to her just before entering parliament, and she is now the sole owner. She has held direct stakes in at least six other UK companies, including the gentlemen’s outfitters New &amp; Lingwood, which measures Etonians for their tailcoats and sells silk dressing gowns for £2,500 each. Murtyhas also held shares in a UK business that operates Jamie Oliver’s Pizzeria, Jamie’s Italian and Wendy’s outlets in India, the nanny agency Koru Kids, and the gym operator Digme Fitness, where she is a director. Both New &amp; Lingwood and Digme furloughed staff during the pandemic. Soroco, a software company co-founded by her brother, lists Murty as a director of its UK arm."
Eric Pickles asks Grenfell inquiry not to waste his time but gets death toll wrong,2022-04-07T19:21:53Z,Hibaq Farah,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7q2d,"A former cabinet minister has challenged the Grenfell inquiry not to waste his time while giving evidence, before getting the death toll from the disaster wrong. Lord Pickles, who served as secretary of state at the then Department for Communities and Local Government between 2010 and 2015, sparked anger after he advised the inquiry’s senior counsel to “use your time wisely” as he had an extremely busy day. Pickles said: “By all means sir, feel free to ask me as many questions as you like, but could I respectfully remind you that you did promise that we would be away this morning and I have changed my schedules to fit this in.” The first report from the Grenfell inquiry found that lessons from the 2006 Lakanal House tower block fire had not been learned by the time of the Grenfell disaster. In response to this, Pickles said that he had come to the view that a swifter response to the coroner’s recommendations in 2013 would not “have made any difference whatsoever”. “This isn’t about deregulation,” he added, but the “nameless victims” and “96 people” who were killed. 72 people were killed in the Grenfell fire, all of whom have been named. The 96 figure Pickles used is the same number of people originally thought to have died in the Hillsborough disaster. The inquiry’s chief counsel, Richard Millett QC, said: “You were spectacularly out of touch with what was happening in your department.” Pickles responded that it was “uncharacteristically unjust” for counsel to say that, and that his was an “enormous department”. Millett said: “Your department was always subject to the deregulatory agenda and you are now seeking to recast that narrative and to underplay what was in truth an enthusiasm by your government for a deregulatory agenda, which led to a complete absence of proper checks and balances so far as concerns life safety.” Pickles replied: “I think that would be unkind.” At the end of the hearing, the inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, thanked him for his time, saying: “I am sorry that it interfered with your arrangements for today, but there were things that we needed to ask you.” The survivors’ group Grenfell United criticised Pickles for what it called his “utter disregard” for victims and called for his removal from government and the House of Lords. “His utter disregard for what happened and to those no longer with us is horrifying, given that he had the ability as minister of housing to reform building safety,” they said. “Eric Pickles must be removed from government and the Lords. Otherwise, government continues to show the contempt it’s always had for people’s safety in this country.” Yesterday several UK housebuilders signed a government-led pledge to fix fire safety problems in apartment blocks built since 1992. The new Building Safety Pledge commits developers to remove unsafe cladding and address fire-safety issues on all buildings of 11 metres tall or higher which were developed in the last 30 years, and not to claim any funds from the government’s Building Safety Fund."
The Girl from Plainville: the unease of TV’s latest true crime hit,2022-04-07T19:10:46Z,Adrian Horton,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7n65,"The reasons to watch and to question The Girl from Plainville, an eight-part Hulu mini-series based on the infamous “texting suicide” case from mid-2010s Massachusetts, are both contained in the final scene of the first episode. The camera hovers behind Michelle Carter, played mesmerizingly by Elle Fanning, who stares at herself in the mirror, face distorted by grief. It’s summer 2014, a few weeks after Conrad “Coco” Roy III (Colton Ryan), with whom Carter had a years-long text-based relationship, killed himself via carbon monoxide poisoning in a K-mart parking lot. Michelle appears to be practicing a speech for his memorial. “I loved him, and he loved me, and he loved all of you guys. I know he did,” she says through tears. But then the tears abruptly stop. Michelle turns around to her laptop to restart a scene from Glee in which Rachel Berry, played by Lea Michele, sings a tribute to Finn Hudson, the character played by Michele’s on and off-screen boyfriend, Cory Monteith, who died of an accidental overdose in 2013. Michelle’s heartfelt words are actually, we realize, merely heartfelt mimicry; her monologue is lifted near-verbatim from Glee. Michelle follows Lea Michele’s monologue to the end of the scene, singing To Make You Feel My Love with operatic gestures, voice raw. It’s a fascinatingly circular, deeply uncomfortable scene: a teenage character obsessed with a famous TV character inspired by tragic real-life events – a disturbing, weird detail lifted from the real-life Michelle Carter story – played for provocation on a TV show assumedly aimed to sketch in the blanks of a well-publicized, polarizing tragedy. There’s a lot here. Is Michelle a psychopath looking for sympathy? A delusional narcissist? An unwell teenage girl so devoid of self-worth that she psychotically over-identifies with a fictional character? Someone deeply moved by television? You could find evidence for any of those readings. The moment is The Girl from Plainville at its best: an exploration of the human behind a seemingly monstrous act (Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a precedent-setting case in 2017 for telling Roy, in several text messages for weeks before his death, to kill himself). It’s also indicative of the fundamental awkwardness of this show, an overlong deluge of unease which gestures at a lot of thorny, circular issues but barely digs into the mess of the real story. Some of this discomfort – the mysterious, bizarre darkness of abnormal psychology, the power of digital communications to warp one’s sense of reality, too-strong identifications with celebrities – feels earned, suggestive, rich. But a lot of it stems from the show’s premise, in making what is fundamentally entertainment out of the deeply tragic digital union of two very wounded, very fragile teenagers. The Girl from Plainville, as a recent true crime series, continually raises the question for its justification – what does this add to a story we already know? Can entertainment illuminate without exploiting? – and doesn’t seem to know the answer. The Girl from Plainville, created by Liz Hannah and Patrick Macmanus, exists at the intersection of several popular TV subgenres. It’s another example of a 2010s headline turned popular documentary/podcast/exposé turned limited series – a narrative second draft of history, as in The Dropout, WeCrashed, Super Pumped and Inventing Anna. (The Girl from Plainville is based on an Esquire article on the real trial, which is also the subject of the 2019 two-part HBO documentary I Love You, Now Die, directed by Erin Lee Carr.) It’s interested in the psychology of chronic lies, such as in the aforementioned true-scam shows, HBO’s Winning Time (on a business level) and Hulu’s The Act (about an infamous 2010s Munchausen-by-proxy story, also explored in Carr’s first documentary, Mommy Dead and Dearest). It offers a complicating, if not redemptive, character study of a publicly villainized woman, a la Pam &amp; Tommy, Impeachment: American Crime Story or documentaries on Britney Spears, Janet Jackson and Lorena Bobbitt. There’s the interest in teen mental health and suicide, as in the controversial Netflix hit 13 Reasons Why and the moral panic over HBO’s hit Euphoria. In The Girl from Plainville and most of the aforementioned shows, there’s also the evergreen and uncanny frisson of seeing a well-known actor transform through hair, makeup, costume and prosthetics into a well-known figure. In other words, much of what The Girl from Plainville is doing is familiar, on a thematic and narrative level; it employs some well-worn prestige TV tropes for better (an interest in the brittle grief of Coco’s mom Lynn, played wonderfully by Chloe Sevigny; meticulous costuming and set design that captures the vibe of suburban 2012-2014) and for worse (muddled multiple timelines, a lagging eight-hour runtime that could have been four). The show is most novel and intriguing in its attempt to convey the emotional realism of consistent texting. In the first three episodes – the immediate aftermath of Coco’s suicide on one timeline, and the initiation of their relationship on a Florida vacation on the other – the phone screen is a haunting presence. Michelle hovers over hers with near-religious fervor, typing and retyping and staring at messages; Lynn’s grief is patterned by texts and calls; Coco buries his chronic depression and loneliness into his phone. By the fourth episode, which dropped last week (the remaining four will air weekly), Coco and Michelle are deep in their secret correspondence – nebulous, toxic, psychoactive. The couple, who only met in person a handful of times, were less lovers than voices in each other’s heads. The show captures some of that blurriness, and why adults just didn’t get it, by putting the texts in the actors’ mouths. Their digital conversations (pulled, it seems, from the real texts) play out as fantasy sequences, one imagining the other in the room with them, staring ravenously at them, as they type. But we barely get to feel it, as the spliced timeline undercuts their exchanges. A fourth episode scene in which Coco tells Michelle that he attempted suicide, for example, cuts to a standard procedural scene in which the prosecutor mulls over zero-sum strategy for how to best pursue Michelle at trial. It’s a frustrating watch; the show’s quality, particularly Fanning and Ryan’s instinctive performances, masks the shallowness of too many ideas, not enough clarity. The first half of the season mostly keeps Michelle a cipher, perhaps necessary for a person who has never participated in a formal interview since her 2015 indictment and did not speak at trial, but an ultimately uncomfortable decision. The intentional, interesting discomfort – reconciling what Michelle said with the vulnerable character on-screen – quickly elides with discomfort over the whole project. Michelle Carter was 17 years old when this all happened. There’s a version of this story that is even more sympathetic to her, a girl who long struggled with eating disorders and anxiety (suggested but not overt in early episodes) who also experienced suicidal ideation as a teen. How much creative license is fair with these real stories? Which truth gets the most bearing? Does audience or truth matter more? These are all messy questions without easy answers, and I say that as someone who will watch the whole series. It’s fitting, I suppose, for an incredibly messy story; the deeper you go – and with all the coverage of the trial, its thousands of pages of text message records, you can go very deep – the messier it gets. Yet you can somehow watch The Girl from Plainville and forget how tragic this whole story is, which is maybe the most uneasy thing of all. The Girl from Plainville is on Hulu on Tuesdays and will air in the UK later this year"
Akshata Murty may have avoided up to £20m in tax with non-dom status,2022-04-07T15:21:39Z,"Peter Walker, Kalyeena Makortoff,  Graeme Wearden, Jessica Elgot and Rupert Neate",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zjp,"Rishi Sunak’s wife has potentially avoided up to £20m in UK tax by being non-domiciled and pays £30,000 a year to keep the status – revelations that come amid growing political pressure on the chancellor. Akshata Murty gets about £11.5m a year in dividends from a stake in an Indian IT firm and declares non-dom status, which allows people to avoid tax on foreign earnings, it emerged on Wednesday. On Thursday her spokesperson said all necessary tax was paid by Murty but declined to say where, as that information was not “relevant”. They conceded it was possible for someone in the multimillionaire’s position to take advantage of tax havens on income earned outside the UK. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said it would be “breathtaking hypocrisy” if Murty had been reducing her liabilities while the chancellor was raising taxes on others amid a cost of living crisis. The row risks further damaging Sunak’s carefully honed brand among voters and Conservative MPs, already hit by last month’s spring statement, with a former minister warning the timing was especially bad coming days after the national insurance rise came into force. Murty has collected about 5.4bn Indian rupees (£54.5m) in dividends from Infosys, the Indian-headquartered IT business founded by her father, over the past seven and a half years, the period for which there is public data. Non-dom status for that whole period could have saved her about £20m in UK taxes. Last year she collected dividends of £11.6m. As a higher rate UK taxpayer she would have been expected to pay 38.1% tax on the payout, which works out at £4.4m. Before 2016, the rate was 30.6%. It rose to 39.35% this week. One factor which could potentially reduce the total Murty would have been eligible to pay would be any reduction under double tax treaties between the UK and India, tax experts said. Murty’s spokesperson said they had no comment on the £20m figure beyond reiterating she paid relevant taxes on UK and overseas incomes. They accepted that people with such tax arrangements could theoretically minimise payments using tax havens, while saying they had no comment as to whether Murty did this. Murty has previously collected other dividend income via the tax haven of Mauritius, which does not tax dividends. The spokesperson also declined to elaborate on the initial explanation for Murty’s non-dom tax status – the fact she has Indian citizenship – when this would still mean such a tax arrangement was a choice. Labour wrote to Sunak with a series of questions on his wife’s tax position. James Murray, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, wrote that it was “in the vital public interest” that he provide clarity on issues including whether he had benefited from his wife’s status, how long she had claimed it and how much she had saved. “As chancellor it is crucial you both follow the rules and lead by example,” Murray said. “Any impression that there is one set of rules favouring a few, and another for everyone else, threatens the integrity of tax policy in our country.” The Liberal Democrats said the case showed a law which bars MPs and peers from having non-dom status should be extended to spouses to avoid any risk of conflicts of interest. There was also concern from some Conservative MPs. A former minister said: “The perception is [an attitude of] ‘what is the problem?’ Here is someone worth £3bn who has a different tax arrangement. I’m sure everything is above board but that’s not the point.” Another Tory MP, a Boris Johnson loyalist, said it would be hard for MPs to stomach given Sunak had put up taxes. “There’s this guy, as rich as Croesus, putting up taxes when people are worrying about the next gas bill.” While Murty’s spokesperson characterised her tax status as a function of her Indian citizenship, tax experts said non-dom status is not automatic but a choice. Prof Richard Murphy, a Sheffield University academic who co-founded the Tax Justice Network, said: “Domicile has nothing to do with a person’s nationality. In other words, the claims made in the statement issued by Ms Murty are wrong.” Mike Warburton, formerly tax director at accountants Grant Thornton, said Murty was entitled to Indian tax domicile because of her father and because she was born there, saying it was “entirely legal and entirely appropriate” for her to do this. He said: “I don’t know, of course, but it may be that those shares are held in an offshore trust, possibly set up by her father. If I had been advising her, I would have suggested it to them. In my view this is all bog-standard planning for anyone who takes professional advice.” Speaking to Sky News, Starmer said the chancellor “has very, very serious questions to answer”. The Labour leader said Sunak had repeatedly raised taxes. “He says all of this is necessary, there’s no option. If it now transpires that his wife has been using schemes to reduce her own tax, then I’m afraid that is breathtaking hypocrisy. “We need complete transparency on this, so that we can all understand what schemes she may have been using to reduce her own tax.” Earlier the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, insisted the chancellor and his wife had been “incredibly transparent” about the arrangement. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “She’s an Indian citizen. And so she, as you say, pays tax here on UK income, but pays tax abroad on foreign income.” But asked where she paid tax abroad – in India or elsewhere such as the Cayman Islands – Kwarteng said: “I don’t know anything about her tax affairs.” Kwarteng added that Murty and Sunak had been “very transparent” about her status, and that Sunak had declared it when he became a minister. “The Treasury, the department which he works in, knows about all those affairs,” he said. “And there is a measure of transparency and he’s been very honest about that. And I think, as far as I’m concerned, that’s good enough for me. And I think we should move on from that story.” Earlier, Kwarteng had told Times Radio that non-domicile status had existed in the UK “for more than 200 years”. He said: “That’s something that’s been well established … I think there’s a lot of malicious attacks on someone who, after all, is a private citizen and is not a politician.”"
County Championship day one: Surrey make solid start – as it happened,2022-04-07T08:58:57Z,Tanya Aldred at Edgbaston,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7m7h,"I don’t know if the CC-Live bar is now empty, but huge congratulations to Essex pair Alastair Cook and Nick Browne, and commiserations to Kent for the spectator sport. An entertaining first day all round, despite the weather, with a particular hey-ho in the wind and the rain to young Sussex. I’m off to wriggle my cramped fingers - see you back here tomorrow. Thanks for all the messages. Good night! Ollie Pope in fine fettle, 27 not out at a run a ball. Four fours off one Brookes over. Surrey 148-3 I’d better write up for the paper, so leave you with the Chelmsford race to 100 (Cook 93, Browne 96); Hampshire rattling along (34-0) after bowling Somerset out for 180 and Gloucstershire struggling (103-6). In Division Two, Sussex stride onwards (240-5, Clark 57 not out); while White and Holden rebuild for revitalised Middlesex (247-3). Glamorgan 164-4 (Ingram 71; Cooke 30) v Durham.

Amla, bat semi-aloft, is bowled! Whatever that ball from Hannon-Dalby did took him completely by surprise. Surrey 126-3. Here we go again: sun out, Amla and Pope both on O. Play will restart at 4.50 here at Edgbaston, with 29.5 overs remaining.The sun is out, the tractors circle, and the spectators have either given up or are hiding inside. Tom Clark (20 yrs old) and Dan Ibrahim (17 yrs old)have put on 40 for the fifth wicket at Hove. Sussex 212-4 (Patterson-White 3-56) It seems Pollock didn’t last much longer. Bowled by Chris Wright for five. In fact, Worcestershire have stumbled to 15-2 as Azhar Ali is run-out for two on his club debut. Ah, I missed this. A lunchtime tribute to ex-Hampshire captain at the Rose Bowl today. Spectators were invited onto the pitch to watch a video, with a minute’s applause afterwards. Warne played for Hampshire in 2000 before returning to captain the club from 2004-2007, scoring his only two first-class centuries for the club, and taking 276 First-Class wickets at 25.58 One of the Five Wisden Cricketer’s of the twentieth century. Might make the 21st century bench too. A superstar. Just spotted that Worcestershire are opening the batting with a young debutant, Ed Pollock, alongside Jake Libby. Pollock was a junior at New Road before moving to Edgbaston. He is the first Warwicks player to hop along to New Road since Moeen Ali in 2007. He’s currently five not out, with a nerve-settling boundary under the belt. At Grace Road, the first ball of the day is about to be bowled at ten past four in the afternoon. De Caires, alas, cut short just 20 short of a maiden ton by Conners. Somerset are all out for 180 after winning the toss and batting. Not the world’s biggest surprise. Little to shout about apart from Hildreth’s 87 and a boundary-heavy 28 by van der Merwe. They’ll be very grateful for those 14 Hampshire extras. Now, what can Siddle do with the new ball? Meanwhile in Cardiff: “It’s great that the season is going again, and even greater that its all on youtube,” writes Andrew Benton. “Not so great is that Glos are now 45-4. At least things can only get better for them....hopefully.” Yes, a tricky start for new captain Graeme van Buuren. Here at Edgbaston, the umpires have trudged on, and trudged off again. Ah, and here come more covers. Such is April. “Good Afternoon Tanya, afternoon everyone listening especially Glos. and Durham supporters.” Hello Em Jackson! “I may be an outlier here, but the rain today surely gives us good reason to take Round 1 of the County Championship abroad - not saying to the UAE or Bahrain or anything “overly distant” but certainly Spain and Portugal perhaps? Either that or play The Hundred now . . . . after all, 100 balls in this weather won’t take long at all.” I’m not sure an early season trip abroad would be very popular with county members looking at their fixture list but your Hundred idea....it would even give the floodlights a chance to shine in the evenings...

The first century of the season pennant has already been raised by Middlesex’s Stevie Eskinazi! Could the times be a-changing at NW6? It won’t be Hildreth who makes the first century of the season either, yorked by Liam Dawson for 87. Somerset 163-7. Four games are currently delayed by rain: Northants v Gloucestershire 36-3 Warwicks v Surrey 123-2 Glamorgan 153-4 v Durham Leicestershire v Worcestershire. No play yet today, wet outfield. The wind at Edgbaston is frankly unpleasant. No problems for Chris Cooke at Sophia Gardens though, currently 29 not out in a rain-ravaged day. Lloyd, Salter, Northeast (on debut, for 24) and Carlson (tipped by me and out for 1) all back in the dressing-room. Glamorgan 153-4. No game for them at Colwyn Bay incidentally this year. They’re off again here at Edgbaston. Sussex (164-3) defying all expectations, despite losing Haines, Alsop and Carter in fairly quick succession. Stuart Broad is due to join injury hit Notts for the second game. With rain still on the tip of everyone’s tongue, the players resume the field at Edgbaston. Hashim Amla 0 not out as he prepares for his first knock of the year. Who could forget last season’s stonewalling effort - 37 not out off 278 deliveries to ensure a draw for Surrey against Hampshire. For now, he stands at the non-striker’s end, hand on hip, jumper sleeves pulled tight to the wrist and OH! There goes Ryan Patel, who will not now be making the first century of the season after having a swing at Hannon-Dalby and being caught behind. Surrey 117-2. So, while the showers come and go, and Essex and Sussex and Middlesex laugh in the face of the doomsayers, tell me your players to watch for 2022. Round and round and round go the tractors with the rope. Meanwhile the sky over the Birmingham skyscrapers darkens once again.. An email flies in from a windswept Chelmsford, where Essex are 120-0. “Should pick the England side from the first players to reach a landmark,” writes Kroome. “Ryan Patel &amp; Nick Browne opening. Alastair Cook close to batting 3, need some bowlers now. Couldn’t be any worse?” It would be particularly helpful if we could “borrow” Abbas too. A maiden half-century for Josh De Caires, or Mike Atherton’s son, as I’m sure he doesn’t want to be known. Middlesex 145-1, up, up and away! Play will resume at Edgbaston at 3pm, if no further rain. Hail at Sophia Gardens has put back the prospects of play there a little longer. Meanwhile James Hildreth has skipped to the 126th fifty of his first-class career - he averaged a mere 22 last year. Early days for a ball of the season - but nominating this for the September awards: The wind causing Warwickshire’s groundsmen all sorts of issues, taking off like kites at Box Hill. Brilliant sunshine, but they must be expecting something. Settled in for the rain? Good - here is something excellent to read on Durham: They’re unrolling the green silky strings of the Warwickshire covers, and nailing them down with tent hooks. This doesn’t look good. Another fifty, this time for Nick Browne. Did these batters not read the memo for April 7? Asks Gareth Wilson: I remember him best for taking 6-5 in 23 balls against Somerset at Guildford to catalyse Surrey’s Championship-winning season, but I think he thinks of himself as a batting allrounder. Belt and braces covers at Edgbaston after a lunchtime squall, and another rain delay at The County Ground, and a further inspection at Grace Road at 1.50pm. At the Rose Bowl, James Hildreth (40 not out) is injecting some backbone into Somerset, while Steve Eskinazi (Middx) and Tom Haines (Sussex) charge on past fifty. Rory Burns gives Danny Briggs a return catch and that’s lunch! Time for a quick stroll and some sustenance - back shortly. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 86-0 v Kent Rose Bowl: Hampshire v Somerset 61-5. County Ground: Northants v Gloucestershire 10-2 Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Surrey 117-1 DIVISION TWO Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 110-4 v Durham Grace Road: Leicester v Worcestershire. No play, rain. Start due 1.10pm. Lord’s: Middlesex 96-1 v Derbyshire Hove: Sussex 101-0 v Nottinghamshire With ten minutes left till lunch, I’m giving the first session of the season to the batters. Nine wickets a relatively meagre haul for the counties bowlers. (with apologies to Hampshire, who have Somerset 52-4) “Hello Tanya.” Hello Simon McMahon! “As well as the first day of the English county season, it also happens to be my 25th wedding anniversary today, and what better way to celebrate than by visiting Lord’s with Mrs McMahon. Thanks for everything Mrs McMahon. I don’t know what I’d do without you. Anyway, to the cricket. Middlesex 56-1 after the first hour at a cold, blustery Lord’s. De Caires and Eskinazi looking well set after Stoneman chipped to mid wicket early on.” Thank you Simon and happy anniversary to you both. Good areas, as they say. Burns lives to fight for another lunchtime after skying Miles into the gloom, but just out of reach of the diving fielder. Somerset, as night follows day, are three down. The good news is that Hildreth, who had a season to forget last year, is into double figures (21). Choosing to face Hampshire’s attack on an April morning was certainly bold. Play will start at 1.10pm after mopping up activities are finished. Durham fans, this is for you: Rory Burns is now joining in the boundary game: plink, plonk, very much like flip the frog. Patel has a huge swing at Miles and misses. Surrey 97-0 and doing Eoin Morgan’s “no fear” thing. Each county is live streaming home games via its website or social media channels. You can also access all streams via the ECB website and commentary is available through BBC local radio. Nottinghamshire have tried four bowlers this morning - all without luck. Young Haines has rattled along to 44. SirAlastair, on the other hand, is in sedate mood at Chelmsford: 16 runs off 51 balls - three of them in boundaries. Here, Surrey skip through the Birmingham daisies - Patel (61 not out off 68) on course for the first hundred of the season. An hour in, how are things looking? Division One: Essex 39-0 v Kent; Somerset 21-2 v Hants; Gloucestershire 2-1 v Northants (late start, wicket with the 12th ball of the day); Surrey 61-0. Division Two: Glamorgan 52-1 vDurham; Leicestershire v Worcestershire start delayed by rain; Middlesex 52-1 v Derbys; Sussex 49-0 v Notts. Kudos to Sussex’s young blades in particular (Orr and Haines). As mentioned BTL, after bleeding players in the off season, the average age of Sussex’s squad for this game was 21.6. Ryan Patel reaches the first fifty of the season with his second six of the morning. Before noon as well, totally without decorum. Surrey 57-0, with a strut a last. Make that Somerset 19-2: Abell nudging Abbott to third slip. Somerset already down on their luck, beset by injuries: Tom Banton (broken finger), Sonny Baker (back), Lewis Gregory (illness), Josh Davey (groin operation). Jack Leach and Craig Overton are also both unavailable. The sun suddenly flashes over Edgbaston like a waft of a lantern. Rory Burns is still cautiously watching the ball over his right shoulder, while Ryan Patel has sped to 40. Surrey 47-0. Oh Somerset, why oh why, oh why? Mohammad Abbas doing Mohammad Abbas things: Ben Green caught at second slip ( Somerset, 19-1). Good morning Gary Naylor! The first wickets to fall come at Cardiff, where Glamorgan’s Andrew Salter has his stumps rearranged by Matthew Potts (23-1,) and Lord’s, where Mark Stoneman begins his season being caught at short midwicket off Shan Masood for 12. Tim has asked me to share this petition, on the future of County Cricket. The ECB’s high-performance review team, which hasn’t actually met yet and doesn’t seem to have a full quota of members, is being asked to come forward with a way to make the English Test team the best in the world and for an improved pathway between the county game and Test cricket. The counties would have to approve any changes (12-6) before next season. First packet of Bourbons opened and consumed. Slow and careful appreciation of the bowling here at Edgbaston (7-0). Both Warwicks and Somerset have so far survived their foolhardy bold decision to bat first. At the County Ground and Grace Road. Hannon-Dalby has the new ball, Rory Burns to face. Liam Norwell has a back spasm after spending nights scrunched up on hospital chairs following the birth of his baby. Surrey and Warwickshire line up next to the Championship trophy. The players trousers are going like the clappers in the glacial wind. We have a moment of unity which also remembers those lost in the off season. I can currently count 78 people in the stands, but there may be more that I can’t spot Something for you to get stuck into: And I forgot to say, do get in touch either via email tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com, twitter @tjaldred or BTL. I’m really hoping this is another belter of a season for Stevens. After the last few years it would be awful to bow out with a whimper. Not that I’m saying he’s bowing out... DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Kent win and will field Rose Bowl: Somerset win and will bat (ARGHGHGGH) County Ground: Northants win and will field Edgbaston: Surrey win and will bat DIVISION TWO Sophia Gardens: Durham win and will field Grace Road: Worcestershire win and will bat Lord’s: Derbyshire win and will field Hove: Nottinghamshire win and will field There’s a bitter, bitter wind blowing across Edgbaston and the players are warming up in woolly hats and long johns. I think I can see at least one pair of gloves, though I’ve forgotten my binoculars so that may not be a hundred per cent accurate. You’ll be glad to know that the coffee machine in the press lounge is in good working order. Rory Burns is waiting in the middle for the toss, his hands firmly in his pockets, hair in a Gareth Bale top knot. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex v Kent Rose Bowl: Hampshire v Somerset County Ground: Northants v Gloucestershire Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Surrey DIVISION TWO Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan v Durham Grace Road: Leicester v Worcestershire Lord’s: Middlesex v Derbyshire Hove: Sussex v Nottinghamshire Good morning! It’s lovely to be back. Welcome to another summer of careers waking and sighing, inexplicable collapses and Darren Stevens . The County Blog lives to fight another season thanks to so many of you who click on to read, and post B(elow) T(he) L(ine). If you’re a regular, thank you for coming back. If you’re new, hello! Please stick around - espresso and custard tarts available just before 11. It’s a murky scene out of the train window as the cross-country trundles past Macclesfield, but there’s a reason that the most northerly games this round are in the midlands, and the forecast is brisk but dry around most of the grounds. A quick resume: the Championship returns to two divisions as decided by the 2019 season, with ten in Division One, eight in Division Two. Nottinghamshire have pulled the shortest straw, languishing in the bottom division despite finally finding their form somewhere behind the laundry basket last summer. Covid regulations have largely disappeared, though those who test positive will have to withdraw from games. Two regulations that come into cricket law in October will be used in the Championship this season: no saliva on the ball, and the new batter to take strike no matter whether the previous batters crossed while a catch was being taken. Points wise: 16 for a win, eight for a tie or a draw (encouragement for counties not to gamble on result pitches.). First innings batting and bowling points in the first 110 overs work like this: Batting Points: 200 to 249 runs - 1 point, 250 to 299 runs - 2 points, 300 to 349 runs - 3 points, 350 to 399 runs - 4 points, 400 runs or over - 5 points. Bowling Points: 3 to 5 wickets taken - 1 point, 6 to 8 wickets taken - 2 points, 9 to 10 wickets taken - 3 points. I’m heading to Edgbaston, where Champions Warwickshire start the season with a visit from Surrey - who can’t have another under-performing season, can they? Plenty to keep an eye on , with Rory Burns’s team of England nearly men, including Ollie Pope and Sam Curran, complemented by Hashim Amla and Kemar Roach. Dom Sibley returns for Warwicks after a winter of rebuilding work - Mark Robinson compared him to an overseas player in terms of his contribution. Elsewhere: Essex and Kent meet at Chelmsford for an (on paper) one-sided affair (Zak Crawley is rested), Somerset have to face Mohammad Abbas and Kyle Abbot at the Ageas Bowl, while Northants and Gloucestershire contest the battle of the newly(ish) promoted. In Division Two, Derbyshire’s Shan Masood avoids meeting his compatriot Shaheen Shah Afridi, yet to land at Middlesex, fresh-faced Sussex take on raging Nottinghamshire, Glamorgan and Durham meet at Cardiff, Worcestershire and Leicestershire at Grace Road. Yorkshire and Lancashire, meanwhile, skip the first round. Lancashire have announced a surplus of £1.8m for 2021 , while all eyes are on Yorkshire, in emergency recovery mode. They just announced a new sponsor, Indian streaming platform Clean Slate, after losing 43 sponsors in the fall out from the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal. “There’s a long journey to go,” Lord Patel told the BBC - “governance reform, culture change, listening to people, mindset changing.” Yorkshire await to hear whether they will be docked points by the ECB’s independent commission. Some other overseas names to look out for, though not all will start today: Hasan Ali (Lancashire), Naseem Shah, Zafar Gohar, Marcus Harris (Gloucestershire), Haris Rauf (Yorkshire), Shan Masood (Derby), Azhar Ali (Worcestershire), Mohammad Rizwan and Cheteshwar Pujara (Sussex), Marnus Labuschagne and Michael Neser (Glamorgan). The teams must throw themselves into the season without knowing how the cards will fall at the end, with a reorganisation likely for 2023, depending on the findings of the High Performance Review sparked by the Test team’s calamitous winter. Is this a referendum on the county game? I’ll leave Mark Robinson to answer that. “Whatever county cricket does it can’t win, can it? I think the game of cricket just needs some good news stories.”"
County Championship: Essex’s Cook and Browne ruffle Kent on opening day,2022-04-07T18:34:53Z,Tanya Aldred at Edgbaston,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pfp,"If the County Championship season started with its traditional squelch, a surprising number of batters were able to see off April’s demons. At Edgbaston, where the wind snapped across the ground like a bad-tempered terrier, terrorising the glove-wearing umpire and billowing the covers, Surrey made steady progress against the reigning county champions, Warwickshire, despite the frequent weather interruptions. Ryan Patel, opening the innings, galloped along to 75 before having a wild swing at Olly Hannon-Dalby, while Ashes flotsam Rory Burns chugged along to a steady 41 in an opening partnership of 117. Hashim Amla was also misled by Hannon-Dalby, stumps-a-splatter for two, and Ollie Pope caressed a quick 40 before stumps. At Chelmsford, old hands Alastair Cook and Nick Browne made the most of a friendly pitch, putting on 220 for the first wicket and each reaching a century as Kent’s bowlers toiled into the swirling gale. Australian Jackson Bird, on debut, dismissed them both in fairly quick succession before Dan Lawrence shouldered arms to a ball that nipped back. Stevie Eskinazi made the first Championship hundred of the year, and his first at Lord’s in five years, in a classy innings of 118 as Middlesex ambled along confidently against a wan and depleted Derbyshire attack. Josh de Caires, Michael Atherton’s 19-year-old son, collected his maiden first-class 50 in an innings of careful cribbage. Derbyshire’s cause was not helped when Ryan Sidebottom, their new signing, limped off the field after 1.1 overs with a suspected hamstring problem. At Hove, Sussex’s rosy-cheeked apple scrumpers, with an average age only just over 21, made sublime progress against big boys Nottinghamshire. Fifties for Ali Orr and Tom Haines, the captain, and 82 not out from Tom Clark frustrated a bowling attack hobbled by injury. Liam Patterson-White, who bowled unchanged for 30 overs from the sea end, the breeze kissing his left shoulder, was the pick with three for 69. Apocalyptic hail thwarted progress at Cardiff, where 71 from Colin Ingram kept Glamorgan steady against Durham. Chris Rushworth trapped an enterprising Sam Northeast lbw on his club debut for 24. There were, though, some batting sides who hadn’t read the memo. Somerset were bowled out for 180 after electing to bat against Mohammad Abbas and co, with only James Hildreth passing 30. Hildreth, in the last year of his contract, played sweetly for 87. Hampshire were 109 without loss at stumps. Ben Sanderson took four for 38 to put Northamptonshire on top in the battle of the promotion class of 2019. Only James Bracey, 77 not out, seriously disturbed the scoreboard as Gloucestershire finished 164 for eight. And Worcestershire’s in-out day against Leicestershire was spoiled by Chris Wright’s three for 33, with Azhar Ali run out for two on his club debut."
Hedwig and the Angry Inch review – Divina De Campo brings drag queen swagger to grunge musical,2022-04-07T18:33:45Z,Mark Fisher,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pez,"John Cameron Mitchell’s grunge musical is the strangest of shows. It combines the kind of high-camp monologue you’d expect at a cabaret club – all knowing narcissism and arch innuendo – with a set of authentically scuzzy rock songs that recall the sounds of a 90s basement dive. Neither has much to do with the other. Dating from 1998, the show prefigures the gig-theatre wave of the last decade and yet exists in its own self-referential universe, too sketchy for narrative engagement, too meandering for emotional impact. In 2022, some aspects seem stranger still. Maybe we can accept Hedwig’s origins in communist East Berlin, but the jokes about Manhattan districts and US middle-of-the-road bands are from another place and time. And yet this high-class production by Jamie Fletcher shows it is in keeping with our gender-fluid age. When Divina De Campo makes her look-at-me entrance as Hedwig from the back of the theatre, milking the audience for applause, she is dressed in a stars-and-stripes cape that opens up to reveal the slogan “gender is a construct”. It’s safe to say that she and her excellent four-piece band, plus Elijah Ferreira as husband, Yitzhak, are happily unconstructed. Hedwig presents herself as the missing link between east and west, top and bottom, male and female, an antidote to binary divisions, as she makes her way from Europe to the US, Lotte Lenya accent intact. De Campo has more than just drag queen swagger; she matches her stage presence with an effortless vocal range, bringing resonance and subtlety to Stephen Trask’s songs. Those songs are an amalgam of rock, funk, boogie-woogie and punk, showing the influences of everyone from Iggy Pop to REM, and expertly performed under the musical direction of Alex Beetschen. Accompanied by Daniel Denton’s colourful video designs, they are the pulsing bedrock of the show. For all the talent on display, the show’s appeal passes me by today as much as it did on its original run in New York. Don’t take my word for it – the audience laps it up with gusto – but I can’t think of a show that leaves me so unsure of the joke or so puzzled about what it is trying to say. • Hedwig and the Angry Inch is at Leeds Playhouse until 23 April."
UK to announce fresh military aid package for Ukraine,2022-04-07T18:33:18Z,Dan Sabbagh Defence and security correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7phm,"Britain is preparing to announce a fresh package of military aid for Ukraine and has demonstrated new missile systems and armoured vehicles that it believes can help Kyiv in the next phases of fighting. Junior defence ministers Jeremy Quin and James Heappey invited Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Volodymyr Havrylov to Salisbury Plain on Wednesday, where they discussed what extra weapons the UK could supply. “It was an honour to show Minister Havrylov and his generals the kit the UK hopes to provide next and to discuss some new weapons that have been trialled recently with UK forces,” Heappey said. The army and Royal Marines demonstrated a range of equipment and “options for further military support”, which, the Ministry of Defence said, included “defensive missile systems and protected mobility vehicles”. The protected mobility vehicle is thought to refer to the Mastiff, a heavily armoured patrol vehicle, first deployed in Afghanistan, which would help Ukraine’s forces achieve greater manoeuvrability against Russian attacks in the eastern Donbas. It is less certain what artillery could be provided, although there has been speculation that the UK could offer the AS-90 howitzer, which has a range of nearly 15 miles and would help Ukraine’s forces contend with Russian shelling. Either would be a modest step up from the 4,200-plus NLAW anti-tank bazookas and the Starstreak anti-aircraft systems the UK has already sent to Ukraine, described by the UK as “defensive weaponry” designed to prevent the Russians from swiftly conquering the country. One source said that Downing Street was likely to make an announcement on the next steps for military aid before the end of the week. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, met Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday afternoon, where the issue was discussed. “Both leaders agreed that the west needed to accelerate its support to Ukraine in the coming days and go further and faster with the equipment it was supplying,” said Downing Street after the meeting. Western countries have begun pledging a fresh wave of military aid after Russia’s initial attack on Kyiv was repulsed, recognising that the conflict had moved to a new phase in which Ukraine is trying to prevent Moscow’s forces advancing in the east and holding on to gains made in the south of the country. A donor conference convened by the UK and attended by more than 35 countries last week hammered out what each state was willing to supply. At the time, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said that the best counter to Russia’s artillery was “other long-range artillery”. Some countries have already announced their plans. The US has committed $400m (£300m) of aid in the past week, including the APKWS rockets that can be used from air and land, and 10 Switchblade 600 drones that employ the same missiles used by the Javelin anti-tank weapon. The Czech Republic has committed tens of T-72 Soviet-designed tanks – the first time a Nato country has agreed to such send heavy armour to Ukraine. But it is still only a modest contribution to Kyiv’s war effort."
Fears genocidal language in Russian media may prompt more war crimes,2022-04-07T18:30:41Z,Andrew Roth Moscow correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zpg,"Two days after Russia began its war in Ukraine, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency accidentally published an article celebrating the country’s lightning-quick victory over Kyiv, crowing that the “period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end”. After a bloody month of war, after the discovery of evidence of war crimes in cities like Bucha and Borodyanka, the language in that same publication has grown even more extreme, containing calls for societal purges and “re-education” that western officials said could provoke further abuses on the ground. “Ukrainianism is an artificial anti-Russian construct that has no civilisational substance of its own, a subordinate element of an extraneous and alien civilisation,” wrote a RIA Novosti columnist earlier this week. The “re-education” of Ukraine could take a generation, he wrote, adding that “besides the highest ranks, a significant number of common people are also guilty of being passive Nazis and Nazi accomplices”. Even the name Ukraine must be erased, the article argued. Views that were once kept to fringe publications in Russia have gone into mainstream outlets and been voiced on primetime TV as the stakes of Russia’s war in Ukraine have risen. Western observers from Ukraine to the United States have grown worried that the language may be encouraging the abuse of civilians by soldiers on the ground. “This is another piece of evidence for a future tribunal against Russian war criminals,” said Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, citing the RIA Novosti article, which caused a major uproar among western officials. One of his aides accused the news agency of calling for the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians. Civilians in Ukraine have reported Russian soldiers citing conspiracy theories about bioweapon labs or telling them they were only here to “cleanse them from the dirt”. “Those sorts of comments are really creating an even more toxic information environment,” a western official said, and could “absolutely contribute” to abuse of civilians in Ukraine. “Responsibility for this, of course lies with the perpetrators of the acts, but it also lies with the Russian leadership,” the official added. Increasingly, Russia’s pundit class has pushed claims that a significant swath of Ukrainian society is under the sway of far-right ideologies, blaming Ukraine’s staunch resistance to the attack on mass psychosis rather than on legitimate anger at the Russian invasion. “To my horror, to my regret, a considerable portion of the Ukrainian people have turned out to be engulfed in the madness of nazism,” said Margarita Simonyan, the head of the RT news network, during a nationally broadcast talkshow on the NTV channel. “That it is on such a massive scale!” Analysts have pointed to the failure of Russia’s war in its early stages, as well as images of protests in cities against Russian occupying forces, for the escalation in Russian rhetoric. Initially Russians believed that “‘de-nazification’ could be completed through regime change and Ukrainians should be liberated,” wrote Greg Yudin, a Russian sociologist, earlier this week. “Obviously, this conception failed when Ukrainians started resisting bravely. A natural conclusion from that: Ukrainians turned out to be deeply infected by nazism.” As Vladimir Putin has called on his officials to push back against the west’s “information war”, claiming reports of atrocities in Bucha were staged, the government line has also grown closer to some of the most extreme opinions in the Russian news. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian prime minister, earlier this week declared that Ukraine would face the same fate as Nazi Germany, an opinion that closely resembled the one written in the column published by RIA Novosti just days earlier. “It should not be surprising that Ukraine, which has been transformed mentally into the Third Reich … will suffer the same fate,” Medvedev wrote in a message shared on Telegram. “That’s what her fate is, that Ukraine!”"
Ban for former Paralympian whose charity paid £1m to family companies,2022-04-07T18:26:12Z,Patrick Butler Social policy editor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pcd,"A former medal-winning Paralympian footballer has been banned from being a trustee by the charities watchdog after an investigation found a disability sports charity he founded paid £1m raised by the public to companies run by him and his wife. The Charity Commission said Matt Dimbylow, 51, who represented the GB seven-a-side football team in the 2008 and 2012 Paralympics, and was a Paralympic World Cup medal-winner, was guilty of serious misconduct and abusing public trust. Of £6m raised for the charity Dream It Believe It Achieve It (DIBIAI) through a lottery scratchcard scheme, £1m was paid to companies run by Dimbylow and his wife, Emma Dimbylow, the commission found. A further £4.2m went on fundraising costs, including payments to an unnamed private lottery operator. Just £300,000 was spent on charitable purposes. “The public expects trustees to ensure charitable funds are always carefully managed in the best interests of their charity and the cause they serve, in this case supporting children and disabled people with sport. Instead, the Dimbylows abused the trust that was placed in them as trustees,” said the Charity Commission’s head of investigations, Amy Spiller. The commission concluded there had been significant breaches of trust at the charity, while its failure to tackle conflicts of interest had led to the pair enjoying “substantial unauthorised financial benefit” that was not in the charity’s best interests. Dimbylow – described as the “driving force” at the DIBIAI – was banned permanently from being a trustee, while Emma Dimbylow signed an agreement promising not to act as a trustee again. The charity is in the process of being wound up, and any remaining funds will be given to another disability sports charity. Matt Dimbylow became involved in the Paralympian game after a head injury in 2003 triggered a Parkinson’s-like brain condition. He also captained the England cerebral palsy football team and was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame alongside Alan Shearer, Michael Owen and Patrick Vieira in 2013. He registered the charity the same year, and the commission concluded he planned to “extract funds from it”. It said it stepped in early on to prevent him, as a trustee, from paying himself an £80,000 salary. He subsequently amended the charity’s governing document to enable it to pay companies owned by himself and his wife. The commission began formally investigating the charity in 2017, and Matt Dimbylow was removed as a trustee two years later. Some of the funds paid by the charity to the Dimbylows’ companies were subsequently recovered by the commission through the courts. While the inquiry was ongoing, the commission said it took action to restrict more than 30 bank accounts held in the charity’s name to stop payments being made without the regulator’s approval. Although the charity fundraising regulator looked into the actions of the lottery operator, no action was taken. The watchdog criticised two other unnamed trustees of the charity, who it said were insufficiently independent and failed to hold the Dimbylows to account for their actions. “Their lack of oversight and scrutiny created an environment where the charity’s funds could be misapplied,” the commission concluded. The commission said it hoped its regulatory action against DIBIAI “sends a powerful message to others who may be tempted to use charity in this way”. Matt Dimbylow and DIBIAI were approached for comment."
Police raid office in Unite union’s HQ in fraud investigation,2022-04-07T18:24:42Z,Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pc3,"Police have raided an office in the headquarters of one of the UK’s biggest unions as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery, money laundering and fraud. More than 20 officers from South Wales police arrived unannounced on Wednesday at the offices of Unite in Holborn, central London. Police took away a number of items including documentation, notebooks and a computer. The raid was part of a joint inquiry by the south Wales force and HM Revenue and Customs. Officers also executed warrants in the South Wales, Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales, Dyfed-Powys and Northamptonshire police areas. A Unite spokesperson said: “A Unite employee is subject to a criminal investigation by the police. On Wednesday 6 April the employee’s office at Unite HQ, in Holborn London, was accessed and searched by the police under warrant.” Unite was Labour’s most generous donor under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the party. In December its new general secretary, Sharon Graham, said she planned to cut donations to Labour and divert the money to union campaigns. Graham, who was elected in August, has launched an inquiry into how the building costs of a hotel and conference centre in Birmingham spiralled into a “potentially significant loss” for the union. The initial projected cost for the 170-room complex was £57m, but the cost soared to £98m, an increase Unite said was a result of safeguarding employment practices onsite. A police spokesperson said: “South Wales police has executed warrants as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery, fraud and money laundering. The warrants were executed on Wednesday 6 April at addresses in the South Wales, Metropolitan, Merseyside, Cheshire, north Wales, Dyfed Powys and Northamptonshire police force areas. “The joint investigation with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is continuing and a number of suspects will be interviewed in due course.”"
Customs IT meltdown adds to long delays at Channel crossings,2022-04-07T18:18:48Z,Joanna Partridge,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pxf,"UK customs officials are battling to resolve an outage in a key post-Brexit IT system, with drivers complaining that the malfunction is adding to long delays for freight traffic trying to cross the Channel. A surge in Easter tourist traffic and reduced sailings from Dover, where several P&amp;O ferries are still out of commission after the mass sacking of crew members, are combining with delays at customs to create havoc on the roads into the port, with parts of the coastbound M20 motorway in Kent turned into a temporary lorry park as HGVs wait to reach France. Haulage industry insiders have put part of the blame for the gridlock on the week-long outage of one of the government’s new trade portals, the goods vehicle movement service (GVMS). It first experienced problems on 30 March and has not been available for use by traders and hauliers since the following day. Drivers are being warned it may not be up and running until Monday. GVMS, which was developed by and is the responsibility of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), has been suffering a systems outage since it was temporarily taken offline during an update to another government customs system, handling import and export freight, known as Chief. Ciaran Donovan, a driver based in the UK who regularly moves goods back and forth between Britain and the continent, said he was unable to use the GVMS portal to get the goods movement reference (GMR) number – a barcode – required to leave the UK last Wednesday. “I had to cancel a job out to Paris on Thursday, which was annoying,” he said. GVMS users trying to access the service have been notified on at least two occasions over the past week that the system would soon be operational again. However, those dates have come and gone and the government has said GVMS will not be up and running again until midday on Monday. Traders trying to access GVMS are notified that HMRC is “still investigating ongoing issues” with the service. In the meantime, HMRC has implemented contingency measures, allowing hauliers to show other evidence that a customs declaration has been made to take goods out of or bring them into the UK, including a transit accompanying document or a movement reference number. Despite these interim measures, truckers say the requirement to provide different customs information is likely to add to processing time at the border. The GMR barcode is scannable and thought to save time. An HMRC spokesperson said: “Our IT systems are stable: we have put in place contingency processes to ensure businesses can keep goods and freight moving while we return to full service.” They apologised for any inconvenience and said they would work closely with customers to avoid disruption, adding that HMRC took “system resilience very seriously”. Donovan said current disruption meant he was working out whether to accept future courier jobs. “I would rather not work than sit there for 20 hours trying to leave the country,” he said. Duncan Buchanan, the policy director at the Road Haulage Association, described the week-long outage to GVMS as “really unhelpful” at a time of an “accumulation” of other problems. The vessels usually operated by P&amp;O Ferries are still out of action after the company’s mass sacking of 800 workers last month, representing a third of Dover’s usual ferry capacity. Bad weather has also delayed some sailings in recent days, just as tourist traffic booms before the Easter holidays, and the traffic backlog was further increased by the breakdown of a Eurotunnel train on Monday. Drivers faced another day of traffic chaos on Thursday as lorries queued for hours to reach Dover port and the Eurotunnel terminal, and Kent residents faced disruption and diversions. A 23-mile stretch of the M20 from junction eight near Maidstone to junction 11 at Westenhanger was closed on Thursday to all non-freight traffic as part of the Operation Brock traffic management system. It was estimated that more than 2,000 lorries were stuck in the queue. “One member reported that they joined the queue at 8pm last night and this morning just before 9am they were still 30 miles from Dover,” said Buchanan, adding that lorry drivers were being forced to wait in their cabs without access to toilets or places to buy food and drink. “We are getting lots of feedback from drivers who are complaining about the absence of facilities. They are basically being advised to take their statutory rest before going to Kent,” he said. Days of traffic chaos have also affected Kent residents and businesses, said Toby Howe, the tactical lead at the Kent Resilience Forum, a partnership of agencies and organisations. “We basically have more lorries coming into the county than can get out the other end,” Howe said. “This issue isn’t going to go away, and it is always Kent and its residents who have to pay the price if there are any problems on the Channel crossings.” Trevor Bartlett, the leader of Dover district council, said in an open letter that the port would remain under severe pressure up to Easter, and he would not hesitate to “declare a major incident” if Dover was again snarled up by port traffic, because of local fears that this could hamper the emergency services."
Video appears to show Ukrainian soldiers shooting Russian prisoner of war,2022-04-07T18:12:43Z,Jenn Selby,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pnp,"Soldiers fighting for Ukraine appear to shoot a Russian prisoner of war outside a village west of Kyiv in a video posted online. The footage was originally shared on social media app Telegram. The New York Times said it had verified the video and the BBC said it had confirmed the location north of the town of Dmytrivka and found satellite images showing bodies on the ground. In the video, at least three men in camouflage, including one with a head wound and his hands tied behind his back, can be seen lying dead next to a fourth man, who is breathing heavily with a jacket covering his head. “He’s still alive. Film these marauders. Look, he’s still alive. He’s gasping,” a man in the video can be heard saying in Russian – a language widely spoken in Ukraine. A soldier then shoots him in the head twice. He continues to move, so the soldier shoots again, and he stops. A soldier can then be heard shouting “Glory to Ukraine”. A man responds with the phrase: “Glory to heroes.” The audio ends with a man saying: “Do not [expletive] come to our land.” The living soldiers in the video are wearing the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow on their arms, while the men on the floor wear white armbands, the colour of Russian troops. A few metres away from the bodies is a BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicle which is used by the Russian airborne unit. BBC investigators attempted to biometrically match the face of one of the men in the video, who can be seen facing the camera with a distinctive beard. They found a match to a Georgian man with close links to Ukraine, but are yet to confirm his identity. The broadcaster believes the word “Gruziny” – which means Georgians in Russian – can also be heard. Scenes in the video match the scenery on Google Street View of the main road outside Dmytrivka, which is about seven miles south-west of Bucha with roads to Irpin. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Thursday he was aware of the video and it would “definitely be investigated”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he had not seen the video, but stated: “I will say that every report on potential violations of international law should be followed or looked into, and of course, any violation of international law and any war crime is always unacceptable.” A war crime is defined by the United Nations as a serious breach of international law committed against civilians or enemy forces during an armed conflict. The video emerges days after the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Russian military of undertaking the worst war crimes since the second world war after the discovery of mass civilian graves in Bucha, a city 15 miles north of Kyiv."
Johnson’s political cowardice applies brake to cheap energy as he bets on nuclear,2022-04-07T18:08:10Z,Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zm5,"The two main criticisms of the government’s new energy security strategy are fair. The tiptoeing around onshore wind, which got gentle words of encouragement but no change to planning regulations, looks a case of political cowardice. It is perverse to apply a handbrake to “one of the cheapest forms of renewable power”, to use the government’s own description, when public opinion is broadly supportive of turbines on land. Objections from Tory backbenchers should have been ignored. Equally, the lack of new measures on energy efficiency is bizarre since every serious body, from the International Energy Agency to our own National Infrastructure Commission, has been banging the drum for ages. “A gradual transition following the grain of behaviour” translates as a win for the cold hand of the Treasury. There were two clear positives in the mix, it should be said. First, the target for more offshore wind is genuinely ambitious. A fivefold increase in capacity to 50 gigawatts by the end of the decade is a significant upgrade on the previous aim of 40GW. The target may even be achievable given the current rate of progress. And from the perspective of energy security – the focus of this policy, don’t forget – offshore’s bigger turbines and higher load factors are always going to score well versus onshore. Second, solar was given a boost with the aim (though not a target, note) to increase capacity fivefold by 2035. It is illogical that the government seems more willing to flex planning rules for solar than for wind, but solar is the quiet success story of the renewables revolution. It has outpaced every cost projection over the past decade. Expansion looks the easiest to deliver. Then, though, one comes to the meat of the plan. The big bet on nuclear is, to put it mildly, hopeful. The government is trying to replace current capacity that will largely go offline by 2050 and also double nuclear’s share of electricity supply versus today’s position. The plan strains credibility. Up to eight new reactors – call it four new two-reactor plants the size of Hinkley Point C – is an enormous undertaking. The best that can be said is that it is possible to imagine how events could, possibly, run favourably. Hinkley could arrive within its revised timetable without further cost hiccups. Sizewell C in Suffolk, the next plant on the block, could attract the desired rush of private-sector investors under a new financing model that would allow the juice to be priced within the £60-£70 a megawatt hour range of political acceptability. And success in financing Sizewell could breed confidence and get the show rolling. There are, though, a lot of assumptions in that list. The biggest unknown is whether the government is prepared to back the EPR design – the one used at Hinkley and set for Sizewell – for all the new plants. Logic says it should because mixing and matching designs is a recipe for higher costs and surprises, a point stressed by the energy analyst Peter Atherton. The productivity gain in constructing Hinkley’s second reactor, for example, is said to be 15%. In a complex process, replicating one design has demonstrable value. The government is not, though, at the stage where it can have sufficient confidence to back EPRs wholeheartedly and mean it. Talk of “leading the world” in nuclear construction should therefore be filed under “believe it when you see it”. You have to know what you plan to build to make such boasts. There is an alarming nuclear-sized question mark at the heart of this strategy. Shareholders push supermarkets towards living wage See, resolutions from agitating shareholders can make a difference. Well, the tale of two pay rises for frontline staff in the supermarket sector cannot be attributed directly to the resolution filed at Sainsbury’s by the campaign group Share Action with backing from Legal &amp; General among others. But it probably helped to concentrate minds in the boardroom. Tesco is raising its minimum hourly rate of pay by 5.8% to £10.10 from late-July. Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s is expected to lift the rate for staff in outer London from £10.50 an hour to £11.05, meaning those workers will join colleagues in the rest of the country in getting the real living wage at a minimum. The shareholder resolution called on Sainsbury’s (and, by extension, its main competitors) to get itself accredited as a real living wage employer, which would require it go further. The commitment has to be permanent and third-party contractors such as cleaners and security guards have to be included. But perhaps the pace is quickening. It should. Large supermarket chains should be able to meet accepted definitions of living wages."
‘Judge Jackson stands on the shoulders of giants’: women of color on a day to celebrate,2022-04-07T18:06:40Z,Maya Yang,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7jng,"Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the US supreme court has passed the Senate and she will now become the first Black female justice on America’s highest legal body after being nominated by Joe Biden earlier this year. Jackson’s nomination has been widely praised by women of color, especially after she sustained grueling confirmation hearings at the hands of some top Republicans who seemed dedicated to political points-scoring and whose criticisms often seemed like racist dog-whistling. Here are four women of color talking about Jackson and the significance of her nomination: Kamala Harris, US vice-president “I’ll tell you what I think you know. Judge Jackson is a phenomenal jurist,” Harris said last month in Selma, Alabama, during the 57th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday”. Jackson “proves her commitment not only to public service but to equal justice and equal rights”, Harris added. “As she makes history, Judge Jackson, like us all, stands on the shoulders of giants. She and we are their legacy.” Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center “The world demands untold levels of strength from Black women on a daily basis. The perseverance Jackson held close is all too familiar to Black women across this country,” Graves wrote in a CNN op-ed last month during Jackson’s confirmation hearings. “We hailed her career and celebrated not only her, but also the work of countless Black women silenced, erased and excluded from the top echelon of the legal profession,” she said, adding: “This will be the legacy of her rise to the supreme court: a young Black girl, one of a generation of Black girls, joyful at the sight of new possibilities for her own life.” Ann Claire Williams, retired US circuit judge of the US court of appeals for the 7th circuit In a statement on behalf of the American Bar Association’s standing committee on the federal judiciary, Williams wrote: “Judge Jackson has a sterling reputation for integrity. Judges and lawyers who have known her in every capacity uniformly praised her character, calling her integrity ‘beyond reproach’, ‘first rate’, and ‘impeccable’.” “Our extensive review leads us to conclude that Judge Jackson meets the highest standards of integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament,” Williams continued, granting Jackson the ABA’s highest rating. Angela Onwuachi-Willig, dean of Boston University School of Law “We don’t only get judged by our actions as individuals, all Black people get judged by our actions,” Onwuachi-Willig said in reference to Jackson’s confirmation hearings. “That’s an enormous weight. Judge Jackson was carrying that weight for hours and hours and hours, and I felt that was a human moment.” “With nearly 10 years of service as a federal judge, experience clerking for Supreme court justice Stephen Breyer and two lower-court judges, and a record of leadership on the United States Sentencing Commission, she will make an incredible supreme court justice,” Onwuachi-Willig also said in a letter, along with more than 200 other Black women law deans and professors, that urged the Senate’s confirmation of Jackson."
Republicans’ ugly attacks on Ketanji Brown Jackson show lurch to far right,2022-04-07T18:05:19Z,Joan E Greve in Washington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7yhp,"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson reached a historic milestone on Thursday, becoming the first Black woman ever appointed to the US supreme court. But before Jackson could be confirmed, she first had to navigate a brutal opposition campaign from far-right critics who challenged her credentials and outlandishly accused her of supporting child abuse. The bareknuckle tactics used by some Republicans to discredit Jackson underscored just how far to the right the party has drifted and may foreshadow a new, disturbing “normal” for American politics. The Republican senator Roger Wicker offered a preview of the ugly attacks to come when he said in late January, before Jackson was even nominated, that Joe Biden’s appointee would be the beneficiary of affirmative action because the president had already promised to select a Black woman for the post. That comment sparked outrage among Democrats, who noted Biden would have a wealth of qualified candidates to choose from to fill Stephen Breyer’s seat. After Jackson’s nomination was announced in February, Tucker Carlson, the far-right Fox News host, took it a step further by demanding that the White House release her score on the LSAT, a standardized test for law school applicants. “So is Ketanji Brown Jackson – a name that even Joe Biden has trouble pronouncing – one of the top legal minds in the entire country?” Carlson asked. “[I]t might be time for Joe Biden to let us know what Ketanji Brown Jackson’s LSAT score was … It would seem like Americans in a democracy have a right to know.” Carlson’s complaint seemed to ignore that Jackson is considered one of the most qualified supreme court nominees in recent history. She has served as a supreme court clerk, a public defender, a district court judge, a member of the US Sentencing Commission and a federal appeals judge. Carlson’s mockery of Jackson’s first name, which is pronounced “kee-TON-jee,” also struck critics as a racist dog-whistle. But worse was to come. The beginning of Jackson’s confirmation hearings last month spurred a new, alarming line of attack from certain Republicans. In a Twitter thread shared days before the start of the hearings, Josh Hawley, a member of the Senate judiciary committee, claimed Jackson had a “pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook for their appalling crimes”. Hawley’s claims were quickly debunked by factcheckers and even conservative legal experts, who showed that Jackson’s sentencing practices for child abuse image offenders were in the mainstream for federal judges. One White House official dismissed Hawley’s claims as an “embarrassing, QAnon-signaling smear”, referring to the baseless conspiracy theory that Democratic leaders are members of an evil cabal involved in child sex trafficking. The left-leaning organization Media Matters reported that Hawley’s comments quickly spread on internet forums linked to QAnon. But instead of abandoning the accusation when it was proved to be demonstrably false and potentially dangerous, more Republican senators joined Hawley in grilling Jackson about her handling of child abuse cases. Lindsey Graham, who voted to confirm Jackson to the US court of appeals for the DC circuit last year, told her during the hearings, “Every judge who does what you are doing is making it easier for the children to be exploited.” Graham, who previously voted for both of Barack Obama’s supreme court nominees and has now become a close ally of Donald Trump, serves as a case study in the Republican party’s move toward the far right. “Lindsey Graham is the epitome of a political parasite. He needs to have a host in order to thrive,” said Tara Setmayer, a former House Republican communications adviser who left the party in 2020. “He did it with John McCain. He did it again with Donald Trump. And now he’s doing it with the Maga/QAnon base in order to maintain relevancy.” Jim Manley, a former senior adviser to the late Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid, said it was “shocking yet not surprising” to see Senate Republicans resorting to such tactics. “It was one thing to work in the Senate and to watch traditionally conservative senators like Chuck Grassley start spouting Tea Party lines in 2009, 2010,” Manley said. “But to see more and more House and Senate Republicans spout QAnon-friendly talking points is a whole ’nother ballgame and shows to me that there’s a real poison moving through the Republican party.” It should be noted that three Senate Republicans – Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney – supported Jackson’s nomination. When Murkowski and Romney announced their support earlier this week, the extremist congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene responded by explicitly accusing Jackson and her supporters of endorsing child sexual abuse. “Any Senator voting to confirm #KJB is pro-pedophile just like she is,” Greene said on Twitter. “You are either a Senator that supports child rapists, child pornography, and the most vile child predators. Or you are a Senator who protects children and votes NO to KJB!” Setmayer warned that Republican leaders’ refusal to condemn the rhetoric of Greene and her ilk will only encourage lawmakers to offer more appeals to QAnon supporters. “They are in the driver’s seat of today’s Republican party, as much as the establishment wants to deny that,” Setmayer said. “And not only is it dangerous, but it undermines our democracy, when people like this are given a platform and are given power.” Manley echoed that point, warning that some Republicans’ embrace of conspiracy theories will make it all the more difficult for Congress to pass even the most basic legislation, such as government funding bills. “I’ve been saying for years the Senate is broken. But what I saw during these confirmation hearings has got me really concerned about our fundamental ability to legislate,” Manley said. “This is far beyond anything that I’ve ever seen before in my time on Capitol Hill.” And there are no signs of this increased extremism among Republican members of Congress diminishing anytime soon. According to Media Matters, at least 59 congressional candidates in the 2022 election cycle have expressed some level of support for QAnon. The success of those candidates would allow the QAnon-supporting faction in Congress to expand its ranks after the midterm elections in November. If that happens, the vicious attacks seen during Jackson’s confirmation hearings may become all too common."
Ketanji Brown Jackson’s blazing trail to become the first Black female justice,2022-04-07T18:04:09Z,Ed Pilkington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7gj5,"Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the US supreme court shatters several glass ceilings in America’s long struggle to form a more perfect union. Not only will she be the first Black woman to sit on the court since it assembled in 1790. She will also be the first justice with experience as a public defender to join a bench that has hosted many former prosecutors. When Jackson takes her seat on the nine-justice panel, following Stephen Breyer’s retirement probably in June, she will also raise its female contingent to four – a historic number that brings a majority of female justices within reach. On a more personal level, her promotion to the supreme court is the fulfillment of her ambition to excel at the law which she has nurtured from a young age. It is the realization of the promise given to her by her parents, who were themselves brought up under the ignominies of racial segregation in the US south. As Jackson said in her opening remarks to the confirmation process: “My parents taught me that, unlike the many barriers that they had had to face growing up, my path was clearer, such that if I worked hard and believed in myself, in America I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be.” Jackson, 51, was born in Washington DC where her parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, relocated to escape Jim Crow in the great migration. The family moved back to Miami, Florida, where she spent most of her childhood. She caught the legal bug from her father who trained to be a lawyer as a mature student when she was at preschool. “He had his stack of law books on the kitchen table while I sat across from him with my stack of coloring books,” she told the Senate judiciary committee. Jackson imbibed from her parents a pride in her roots. They gave her an African name: “Ketanji Onyika”, meaning “lovely one”. Born in 1970, Jackson describes herself as a child of the 70s. She was aware that the educational and other opportunities she enjoyed as a member of a burgeoning Black professional class were a product of the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 60s. After Miami Palmetto senior high school she studied as an undergraduate at Harvard, followed by Harvard law school. It was at college that she met her husband, a surgeon, Patrick Jackson; they have two daughters, Talia, 21, and Leila, 17. At her confirmation hearings, Republican senators attempted to depict Jackson as a rabid leftist in hock to socialist groups. The truth is much less dramatic: as an individual and a jurist, she has preferred compromise over conflict, evidential fact over ideology. “She was always the person trying to find the middle ground,” one of her Harvard roommates, Nina Coleman Simmons, told the Washington Post. Pressed by Republicans at the confirmation hearings to divulge her “judicial philosophy”, she insisted she had none. Rather, she relied on what she called a “methodology” based on neutrality, the facts in the case and a faithful reading of the law. Jackson emphasized at the confirmation hearings that her outlook was influenced by her wider family. She has two uncles who were police officers in Miami while her brother, Ketajh, worked for the Baltimore police department before joining the Maryland army national guard. Jackson did not mention that she had another uncle, Thomas Brown, who was sentenced to life in prison for minor non-violent drug offenses under a brutal three-strikes law. He was released in 2017 after Obama commuted his sentence, but died soon after. We do not know, given her near silence on the issue, whether Thomas’s plight influenced her decision to work as a federal public defender in Washington. It is notable that during the two years she spent in that role she successfully challenged several cases involving excessively long sentences. Republicans sought to cast doubt on her sentencing of sex offenders, implying she was sympathetically lenient towards them, but factcheckers have found her approach to have been entirely unremarkable for such cases. In probably her most famous district court ruling, in 2019 she ordered the former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify before Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian interference. Rejecting Donald Trump’s claim of executive privilege, she stated: “The primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that presidents are not kings.” Trump was also the subject of one of the few cases she has adjudicated on the federal appellate court in Washington since Joe Biden nominated her last year. In December she ruled for a second time against Trump, finding that the congressional committee investigating the Capitol insurrection on January 6 had a right to see White House records. Jackson’s arrival on the highest court will not change its six conservative to three liberal-leaning power balance. But given that supreme court justices are appointed for life, she could serve for three decades or more and in so doing help to shape the country’s judicial landscape for at least a generation. There will be no honeymoon period: she will be flung immediately into some extremely thorny cases in her debut October 2022 term. She has said that she will recuse herself from one of the most politically charged cases on the docket – challenges to affirmative action at Harvard and the University of North Carolina – given her current role with Harvard’s board of overseers. But there are many more highly contentious cases already piling up, including a dispute over the Clean Water Act relating to wetlands, a look at welfare laws for Native American children, and the question of whether artists, in this case a website designer, can be obliged to do work celebrating gay marriage when it goes against their religious beliefs. Her initiation to the nation’s highest court is already shaping up to be a blockbuster."
Russia suspended from human rights council after UN general assembly vote,2022-04-07T16:17:32Z,David Smith in Washington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pf3,"Russia has been suspended from the United Nations’ leading human rights body as its invasion of Ukraine continues to provoke revulsion and outrage around the world. At a meeting of the UN general assembly on Thursday, 93 members voted in favour of the diplomatic rebuke while 24 were against and 58 abstained. This met the required threshold of a two-thirds majority of the assembly members that vote yes or no, with abstentions not counting in the calculation. “War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted in response. “Grateful to all member states which … chose the right side of history.” The US ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, had launched the effort to suspend Russia from the 47-member human rights council with the world still recoiling from images of mass graves and corpses strewn in the streets of Bucha following Russian soldiers’ retreat. Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine’s UN ambassador, introducing the resolution before the 193 members of the general assembly, said Russia has committed “horrific human rights violations and abuses that would be equated to war crimes and crimes against humanity”. Kyslytsya added: “Russia’s actions are beyond the pale. Russia is not only committing human rights violations, it is shaking the underpinnings of international peace and security.” Russia’s deputy ambassador, Gennady Kuzmin, urged members to vote against the resolution. “What we’re seeing today is an attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and total control,” he said. “We reject the untruthful allegations against us, based on staged events and widely circulated fakes.” Kyslytsya responded to Russia’s complaints about the proceeding, saying: “We have heard, many times, the same perverted logic of the aggressor trying to present itself as the victim.” Among countries voting against the resolution were China, an ally of Moscow that has declined to criticise the invasion, Iran, the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan and communist Cuba, as well as Belarus, Syria and Russia itself. The 58 nations that abstained included Brazil, India, Mexico, Senegal and South Africa, with many urging diplomacy instead. TS Tirumurti, India’s ambassador, said: “When innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option.” Russian forces have been accused of multiple war crimes since the invasion of neighbouring Ukraine on 24 February. They include indiscriminate bombing, rape, torture and summary executions. Chuck Schumer, the US Senate majority leader, has accused Russia of committing “genocide”. Russia is the first permanent member of the UN security council to have its membership revoked from any UN body. It is also only the second country to have its membership rights stripped at the human rights council, which was established in 2006. The assembly suspended Libya in 2011 when upheaval in the north African country toppled its longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi. The human rights council is based in Geneva and its members are elected by the 193-nation general assembly in New York for three-year terms. The March 2006 resolution that established the rights council says the assembly may suspend membership rights of a country “that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights”. Thursday’s resolution expressed “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly at the reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights”. Thomas-Greenfield wrote on Twitter: “An important and historic day. Countries from around the globe have voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. We have collectively sent a clear message that Russia will be held accountable.” Kuzmin of Russia described its adoption as an “illegitimate and politically motivated step with the aim of demonstrably punishing a sovereign member state of the UN conducing an independent domestic and foreign policy”. He said Russia had decided to give up its membership of the council with immediate effect. A British representative raised a point of order and observed: “That sounds like someone that’s just been fired tendering their resignation.”"
The Guardian view on non-dom tax status: them not us,2022-04-07T17:48:03Z,Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p8c,"It is not the legality of what the chancellor of the exchequer and his wife do with their money that matters; it’s the message that their choice sends about inequality and unfairness in Britain today. Rishi Sunak lives in Downing Street with his wife and their two children. As chancellor of the exchequer, he is in charge of the UK’s tax system and the country’s finances at a time when everybody’s living costs are soaring and public money is extremely tight. Mr Sunak naturally pays UK taxes on his earnings and assets. His wife, Akshata Murty, does not. Although she has lived here for much of the past decade, Ms Murty holds non-domiciled tax status in the UK. This means that she pays no UK tax on her overseas earnings, on the basis that her permanent home is not here. Ms Murty is very, very rich indeed. Her stake in her Indian father’s technology business alone is worth an estimated £690m. She would have received around £11.5m in dividends from these shares in the last tax year. If she was a UK taxpayer, the Treasury would have taxed that at a rate of 38.1%, bringing in well over £4m a year to the public finances. Ms Murty has broken no law by shielding that money from the Treasury. Her office stresses that she has also paid overseas taxes on the earnings. The UK’s independent adviser on ministerial interests has approved the arrangements. Non-dom tax status, after all, has existed since the colonial era. Regrettably, it remains legal. It is based on the idea that while a person may live here all year round, as Ms Murty does, they regard a foreign country, in this case India, as their true home. At the last count, some 75,700 individuals claimed non-dom status, thus depriving the Treasury of nearly £8bn in taxes and national insurance. But the overwhelming majority of taxpayers who live in this country do not have this option. That is why the Sunak-Murty finances matter. At a time when personal taxes have just gone up, when the cost of living is rising steeply, when inflation is increasing, and when benefits are falling in value in real terms – and when Mr Sunak is the all-powerful minister responsible for every single one of these issues – the revelation of his rich wife’s choice of non-dom status sends a message that there is one law for the rich and another law for the rest of us. This may be legal, but it is, quite simply, unfair. For the Conservative government, and for Mr Sunak in particular, this is a serious moment. The partygate revelations, whose repercussions are far from over, caused Tory fortunes to plunge precisely because they showed that the sacrifices ordinary people were making for the common good were not being taken seriously by their rulers. This new disclosure says something similar. A less complacent government than this one has now become would surely have seen this embarrassment coming. It is another big blow to Mr Sunak’s reputation and ambitions, after a shabbily constructed spring financial statement and a steep downturn in the chancellor’s popularity ratings with the public and the party. His position as the heir apparent now looks fragile, and Boris Johnson may even decide to look for a more biddable chancellor in the summer reshuffle, assuming he survives that far. Just when the Conservatives may have hoped that the Ukraine war might conveniently push domestic concerns aside during the local election campaign, here is another reminder that this government’s loss of moral authority may in fact now be terminal."
The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s energy strategy: missed opportunities,2022-04-07T17:47:18Z,Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zat,"A few weeks after the November Cop26 summit concluded in Glasgow, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy published a striking snapshot of public attitudes towards the climate emergency. It showed that popular support for renewable energy, including onshore wind farms, had reached record levels. Given a cost-of-living crunch caused by the rocketing price of fossil fuels, and the new priority of energy independence following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an imaginative and proactive government would move to harness this enthusiasm and seize the moment. Sadly, Britain is not blessed with such a government. The future energy strategy unveiled by Boris Johnson on Thursday instead carries some of the hallmarks of his flawed government: a prime ministerial penchant for grands projets that may or may not be deliverable; a tendency to be unduly influenced by vocal lobby groups on the right of the Conservative party; and a propensity to set targets without doing the necessary work to enable them to be met. The aspiration that 95% of the UK’s electricity should come from renewable sources by 2030 is admirable, and the commitment to hugely increase offshore wind and solar capacity is significant. But inexplicable lacunae and wrong priorities make this a tale of missed opportunities. The government has placed nuclear power at the heart of its approach, promising that as many as eight new reactors will be built. The realpolitik of meeting net zero targets means that nuclear, as a least worst option, should be part of the future energy mix. But the scale of Mr Johnson’s ambition represents a hugely expensive long-term gamble, the funding of which is conveniently buried somewhere in the long grass. According to the government’s own calculations, the journey from initial investment in a plant to the generation of electricity takes up to 17 years. Meanwhile, far faster routes to fulfilling net zero obligations and driving down spiralling fuel bills have been rejected or ignored. Four out of five members of the public support the use of onshore wind farms, which could be built quickly and cheaply if planning rules were eased. This was rumoured to be on the cards. But Mr Johnson has instead bowed to the nimby instincts of Tory MPs and ministers, whose views are at odds with the mood of the country, but who have the power to make life difficult in parliament. Limited consultations with some “supportive” communities will have next to no impact and a game-changing possibility has been lost. A golden chance to fund greater energy efficiency and better insulation in Britain’s leaky housing stock has also been missed, despite the relief this would afford the less well-off in particular. The Treasury’s apparent refusal to fund the expansion of an existing scheme to help poorer households is particularly callous, given the eye-watering bills that will drop on doormats next winter. But it is also emblematic of an administration that consistently fails to grasp the bigger picture. Promoting demand-side energy efficiency is fundamental in the drive to net zero, but the government must make the transition to green energy attractive, feasible and affordable if people are to take the plunge in their own homes. The public knows that radical action is needed to cope with long-term and short-term energy crises. This flawed strategy for the future demonstrates that the government has yet to find the courage to rise to the challenge."
Spain reverses plan to open borders to Britons without Covid vaccine ,2022-04-07T17:40:44Z,Geneva Abdul,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pcn,"The Spanish tourist board in London has performed a U-turn on its announcement that the country will open its borders to unvaccinated British holidaymakers. The tourist office first told travellers that Spain would open up to all Britons, regardless of vaccine status, as long as they could provide a negative pre-departure test. But, in the latest disruption to the Easter holidays, the decision was reversed within hours. The rapid about-turn was due to what the tourist board called a “miscommunication” due to a “misinterpretation” of entry requirements published by the Spanish health department. “We apologise unreservedly,” Pedro Medina, the deputy director of the Spanish Tourist Office in the UK, said in a statement. British travellers aged 12 and above are still required to show proof of being fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to arrival in Spain, or to show a recovery certificate from coronavirus within a 180-day period of testing positive. The tourist office added: “If more than 270 days have passed since the final dose, certification of a booster vaccination is also required, except for teenagers aged 12 to 17 inclusive.” On Twitter, Julia Lo Bue-Said, the chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership group, the UK’s largest independent consortium of travel agents and travel management companies, called the reversal a “spectacular blunder” and “just madness”. However, children aged 12-17 are able to get into the country provided they show a negative PCR test within 72 hours of arrival in Spain. The announcement was first made in February when the Spanish government said children aged 12-17 from non-EU countries no longer needing to be fully vaccinated. Spain, one of the UK’s most popular overseas holiday destinations, is among several EU destinations requiring anyone who was vaccinated more than 270 days ago to have a booster to enter the country."
Sir Alex Ferguson’s Clan Des Obeaux wins Betway Bowl at Aintree,2022-04-07T17:31:32Z,Greg Wood at Aintree,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pk2,"Sir Alex Ferguson was celebrating on Merseyside for the second year running on Thursday as Clan Des Obeaux, the best horse he has owned in nearly 25 years in racing, took the Betway Bowl on the opening day of the Grand National meeting at Aintree. The former Manchester United manager had an interest in two runners in the race, and the money beforehand suggested that Protektorat, from the Dan Skelton yard, was fancied to land the first Grade One win of his career. Clan Des Obeaux was always travelling sweetly for Harry Cobden, however, at a track that plays to his strengths, and despite idling on the run-in he got home by a length from the Irish Gold Cup winner, Conflated. “We couldn’t believe the price he went out to,” Ferguson said. “Protektorat was a worthy favourite but maybe the Gold Cup [in which he finished third] had just taken a bit out of him. “Racing is part of my life more than football now. I’ve a few with [co-owner] Ged [Mason] and John Hales and we got great enjoyment last year winning three Grade Ones here. I never won three in a row at Anfield, that’s for sure. I need to speak to Paul [Nicholls] about the Grand National [next year]. He will be 11 and it is probably the one thing to try at his age.” There was a dramatic conclusion and aftermath to the Anniversary 4YO Hurdle earlier on the card as Knight Salute and Pied Piper initially dead-heated for first in the Grade One event, before Knight Salute was awarded the spoils in the stewards’ room. The stewards decided that Pied Piper had impeded Knight Salute by jumping left at the final flight, despite being told by Paddy Brennan, his rider, that he had not lost any momentum and that he felt a dead heat was “a very fair result”. Davy Russell, meanwhile, told the officials that he had gone too soon on the 10-11 favourite. “I knew riding the race it was completely wrong,” Russell said, “but he travelled so well and my hands were tied.” Milton Harris, whose colourful life and career has included drinking sessions with Cary Grant, dating Belinda Carlisle and seven years without a licence after being declared bankrupt, was celebrating his first Grade One success. “It doesn’t sit easy with me as they’ve had a good battle,” Harris said. “I was happy with the original result but the stewards have a job to do. “When he [Pied Piper] has given him a bump, that has probably helped him. He is a hardy warrior.” Sam Waley-Cohen, one of Britain’s top amateur riders for more than two decades, said he will retire from the saddle after riding Noble Yeats, owned by his father Robert, in Saturday’s Grand National. Waley-Cohen, 39, was the first amateur to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup for 30 years when he steered Long Run to victory in 2011, and also won the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park on the same horse in 2011 and 2012."
British man and son missing after dive off coast of Malaysia,2022-04-07T17:30:35Z,Geneva Abdul,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pj7,"Rescuers are searching for a British father and son off the coast of Malaysia after the pair disappeared on Wednesday during a group training dive. Adrian Chesters, 46, and his 14-year-old son, Nathen, were diving off the coast of Mersing, in the southern state of Johor. Alexia Alexandra Molina, 18, from France, also remains unaccounted for. Police said on Thursday that they still believed the divers would be found. The district chief, Cyril Edward Nuing, said: “With their equipment, their full gear and their experience, we believe there is a strong chance of finding them alive.” Diving has since been suspended off Mersing, with the boat’s skipper detained by police amid the investigation. Diving instructor Kristine Grodem, 35, who was training the group for their advanced licences, has been found safe after becoming separated from the group. An hour into the dive, alarms were raised after the group did not surface. According to maritime officials, Grodem was rescued by a tug boat before being airlifted from the scene. Grodem told police that the three others had managed to surface. The search resumed on Thursday morning after being called off late on Wednesday due to poor visibility. The rescue effort included two planes, 18 boats and nearly 90 personnel including rescue divers. “We cannot allow diving to continue if safety measures are compromised,” said Johor’s sultan, Ibrahim Iskandar. Malaysia reopened its borders to foreigners on 1 April after they were closed for more than two years during the Covid-19 pandemic. Malaysia’s immigration department said more than 55,000 foreigners had entered the country in the first four days since the border opened."
Trial of Greek pilot accused of murdering British wife Caroline Crouch to begin,2022-04-07T17:30:34Z,Helena Smith in Athens,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p9f,"The trial of a Greek helicopter pilot accused of strangling his British wife as she slept next to their baby daughter is due to begin on Friday in Athens. Nearly a year after Caroline Crouch was found dead in the couple’s maisonette, her husband, who had originally tried to blame the murder on ruthless “foreign thieves”, will appear before a mixed jury court in the Greek capital. It will be the first time Babis Anagnostopoulos, 33, has been seen in public since his alleged confession to a crime that has gripped the nation. “We have been waiting for this moment,” the Crouch family’s lawyer, Thanassis Haramanis, told the Guardian. “We are confident that justice will prevail.” In a trial that is likely to be as dramatic as it is long, the UK-trained aviator could take the stand within hours of the hearing getting under way. For the first time in Greek legal history the defendant, who stands accused of pre-meditated murder and attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying to police, also faces the charge of killing an animal, under groundbreaking legislation passed last year. The pilot allegedly admitted using a leash to hang Crouch’s seven-month-old puppy, Roxy, from the banister of the couple’s home in suburban Athens to make the break-in seem more realistic. Investigators encountered the choked pet before finding Caroline’s body next to her crying daughter, Lydia, on the upper level of the maisonette. “He will do everything to reduce his sentence and convince the court that Caroline’s death wasn’t pre-meditated,” Haramanis said. “But he also faces the prospect of 10 years or more in prison for killing Caroline’s puppy.” Roxy, a stray dog adopted only months before the 11 May murder, has been assigned separate legal representation, paid for by an animal welfare group that has urged members to protest outside the court alongside women’s organisations enraged at the killing – one of 17 femicides in Greece last year. For 37 days, Anagnostopoulos claimed his wife’s death was the result of a botched burglary, during which time he gave a heart-rending eulogy at her funeral on the island of Alonissos, where 20-year-old Crouch was raised. It was only after eight hours of police questioning – following his arrest at her memorial – that investigators allege he confessed to the crime. Police, who had encouraged the government to take the rare step of announcing a €300,000 (£250,000) reward for information that might lead to the assailants, said they had been fooled by a man they described as a “top-class actor”. Anagnostopoulos, who is detained in Athens’ high-security Koyrdallos prison, has claimed, through his lawyers, that his wife’s “narcissistic and aggressive behaviour” were to blame for the fit of rage that prompted him to commit the crime. But in a 24-page report, Giorgos Noulis, the public prosecutor assigned to the case, contended otherwise, saying the pilot was in a “calm state of mind” when he chose to kill the student. “He had no inhibition to go through with the act despite the fact that she was the mother of his child,” the magistrate was quoted as saying in the report, excerpts of which appeared in the Greek press. “The victim was just 20 years old, while he was 13 years older and should have been her protector.” The daughter of a retired oil executive who settled on Alonissos, Crouch had been asleep for more than two hours before her murder. Investigators, piecing together the sequence of events based on a handwritten diary that spoke of an increasingly abusive relationship, believe she threatened the pilot with divorce during a heated altercation earlier that night. Her death was depicted as “agonising” by a coroner, who estimated after examination of her body that asphyxiation “took five to six minutes”. Greek media reports describe Anagnostopoulos as having spent months poring over legal textbooks in an attempt to finesse his defence. At least four witnesses from the couple’s “broader social circle” will testify in his defence, his lawyer, Alexandros Papaioannidis, said before the trial. Haramanis said it was unclear if Crouch’s parents, who now have custody of Lydia, would attend proceedings. “Her mother can still not believe that she was consoled by the man who took her beloved daughter away,” he said. “I don’t know if they could bear to be in the same room with him.”"
"Anna Karenina review – this striking, steamy, seductive ballet is a masterpiece",2022-04-07T17:30:10Z,Elissa Blake,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7t7a,"Just before the opening of Anna Karenina, one of the most famous Russian stories of all time, a message is projected on to the stage: “The Australian Ballet opens our heart to the victims of the war in Ukraine.” It makes for a sobering prologue to this much-anticipated production, which was twice postponed by the pandemic, and now opens in Sydney on a day when the world is learning of Russian atrocities in the city of Bucha. It is a dark time to be watching this story. The ballet’s choreographer, Yuri Possokhov, was born in Lugansk, Ukraine, and trained in Moscow before joining the Bolshoi Ballet. His distilled and beautifully spare version of Leo Tolstoy’s epic tale of love, adultery, morality and duty, is a jointly commissioned production by Chicago’s Joffrey Ballet and the Australian Ballet. It is a ballet for adults rather than children: no lavish “chocolate-box” elements, no snow on stage, no one arrives in a troika, there are no ballrooms. Instead, we witness a complex psychological drama full of yearning and restraint, desire and madness, on a bare stage with little more than a bed, an easel or a hay bale to provide physical context. Robyn Hendricks, as Anna, is already a superstar of the Australian Ballet and here she is mesmerising as the young married woman expressing her full seductive power with liquid movements of her arms, draped in black velvet and lace, or a simple stretch of her neck. Later, she lets rip with partner, Callum Linnane (Anna’s lover, Count Vronksy), in one of the steamiest sex scenes in ballet. Linnane is a rising star who brings palpable heat to the role. His Vronsky is a young soldier with plenty of snap in his legs and a towering, luminous beauty. His acting isn’t as strong as Hendricks’, who is magnificent in her mad scene, but their dancing together looks effortless. Hendricks makes it clear that Anna knows their love story can never work out. One dance, in which a feverish Anna dreams of having a husband (Adam Bull as Alexei Karenin) and a lover simultaneously, is a highlight of the production. In the smaller featured roles, Benedicte Beme is bright, sharp and bouncy as the teenage debutante Kitty Shcherbatskaya, and her soon-to-be husband, Konstantin Levin, is performed beautifully by Brett Chynoweth, whose final solo is a knockout. For those in the audience who don’t already know Tolstoy’s story, it might be hard to follow. The plot isn’t spelled out but the striking and sophisticated visual images help the viewer. The train station, the racecourse and a field in the countryside are supported by projected film and glorious lighting (by David Finn) that washes over the stage. The dancers are dressed in the colours of a Rothko painting, burnt orange and red or dark shades of blue, with designer Tom Pye drawing on 19th-century underwear designs for Anna’s “undressed” looks. The music composed by Ilya Demutsky, one of the most sought-after composers in the world, is a real star of the production. The piano is often front and centre, with wind instruments rather than strings driving the emotion. At times, it sounds like a sweeping film score. Occasionally, the musicians are so quiet and still that we lean in to hear them. This production is a modern masterpiece to be savoured, a gift for those who love ballet, students of the artform and anyone who appreciates literature, design and music. Anna Karenina, the Australian Ballet, is on at the Joan Sutherland theatre, Sydney Opera House, until 23 April"
Australia relaxes summer ban on live sheep exports to Middle East ,2022-04-07T17:30:09Z,Calla Wahlquist,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mtb,"Australia has rolled back a ban on exporting sheep to the Middle East during the hottest months of the year in a move animal rights groups say ignores scientific recommendations introduced to protect animal welfare. The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment announced adjustments to the summer export ban this week, based on climatological data that it said resulted in an increased risk of heat stress in the Persian Gulf in May, and reduced risk of heat stress for sheep travelling through the Red Sea in early June. The live export of sheep to most ports in the Middle East is banned from 1 June to 14 September. But Australian exporters will be allowed to take sheep through the Red Sea to Israel from 1 to 14 June. The ban on exporting to some Persian Gulf destinations, including Qatar but not the major live export ports of Oman and Kuwait, will begin a week early on 22 May. Dr Jed Goodfellow from the Australian Alliance for Animals said the changes were contrary to the findings of a heat stress review commissioned by the government, and could result in sheep deaths. The McCarthy review, commissioned after whistleblower footage showing sheep panting and experiencing heat stress during a deadly voyage on the Awassi Express in August 2017, identified heat stress as a risk on all shipments occurring between May and October. The summer export ban, first introduced in 2019, has only ever run from June to September, to allow Australia’s two remaining live sheep exporters access to key global markets. Goodfellow said allowing sheep to be exported through the Red Sea in June would push them to their “biological limit” and risked a significant mortality event. “You get one adverse weather event, temperatures higher than expected, and basically half of the sheep on the ship could die,” he said. Goodfellow said the adjustment to the summer ban, which followed lobbying from exporters, showed that the trade would not be able to exist if all the scientific advice around reducing heat stress was followed. “It just shows the fact that the trade is fundamentally incompatible with acceptable welfare standards,” he said. “The business model is based on a degree of animal suffering, because if you act on the science and in accordance with animal welfare the trade becomes unviable very very quickly.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The agriculture department in February announced it would be conducting “additional stakeholder engagement” on its review of live sheep exports during the Middle Eastern summer, which is expected to be completed by the end of June. It also said it was funding ongoing research by LiveCorp and the export industry, which “will further ascertain and align sheep physiological and behavioural changes observed during a voyage with other data”. “This will include additional onboard data collection including using automated rumen data loggers to continuously measure sheep core body temperature,” it said. The chief executive of RSPCA Australia, Richard Mussell, said there was no need to conduct additional research. “All the data and evidence is already there – it’s just being dismissed,” he said. “Live export does not enable the most basic of animal welfare needs.” Mussell said the decision to wind back part of the summer ban was “deeply concerning”. “It’s also very worrying that these regulations have been put in place now, on the eve of a federal election being called – when parliament may not sit again for months and so may not have the chance to scrutinise these last-minute changes,” he said. Animals Australia director Lyn White said the three-month ban was “already grossly inadequate” and reducing it would “increase the perils sheep will face”. Greens senator, Mehreen Faruqui, said it was concerning that the change had been made without parliamentary oversight. “The Senate has been denied the opportunity to do its job in scrutinising these changes and considering whether to disallow them before they come into effect,” she said."
"‘Old-school, 1950s grandma food’: Australian chefs on reviving retro recipes",2022-04-07T17:30:09Z,Max Brearley,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7n83,"We all love a kitchen comeback. Think the return of meatloaf, or when, inexplicably, prawn cocktail got its groove back. Chefs are skilled at trawling the depths of nostalgia, from the trope of “I learned to cook this dish at my nana’s knee”, to mining collective food memories. “I’ve always gone back and done a lot of reading of old cookbooks,” says chef Blaze Young, who heads up the kitchen at Fremantle wine bar Nieuw Ruin. “I kind of love old-school, 1950s grandma food, and old Australiana.” Young isn’t wed to her own grandmother’s style of cooking; she also enjoys interpreting the food memories of others. One such effort, a confit fish “under a fur coat”, has become her signature dish. The childhood memories of Nieuw Ruin’s owner Dimitri Rtshiladze were the inspiration for this spin on “herring under a fur coat”. Rtshiladze, who is of Georgian descent, told Young about the eastern European classic. “Traditionally it’s made with tinned, preserved herring, and then it’s layered with cold vegetables,” she says. “I guess to make the herring a little bit more appetising.” Young uses monkfish from Scott Reef off the north-west coast of Western Australia. It is a by-catch, which she says has a “beautiful vegetal flavour” reminiscent of leeks when slowly confited. A bottom layer of blanched potatoes is dressed sparingly with pickled shallot, followed by the confit monkfish, fresh dill, then blanched carrot, roast beetroot spiked with a little bit of horseradish, with a final layer of egg salad made with a quality olive oil mayonnaise. The six layers are prepared “incredibly simply”, says Young, making them “really clean examples of that ingredient” when eaten individually but “really complex and interesting” when eaten together. The final touch is salty, smoked Yarra Valley caviar – an element of decadence for a traditionally humble dish. In Sydney, food writer Jill Dupleix’s dreams of comeback dishes were brought to life at relative newcomer, Ursula’s in Paddington. “My gran used to do the best flummery ever,” she says. “It would float off the table, and there it is at Ursula’s.” Phil Wood, chef-owner at Ursula’s, says “It used to be well known, featured in those guides to home cooking for the Australian housewife, like the CWA books, The Golden Wattle Cookery Book. [But] a lot of it has just kind of fallen by the wayside a little bit … It’s remarkable how quickly things can disappear within a generation.” While flummery’s English cousin is centuries old, the Australian version of flummery was born out of post-war necessity, says Wood. The original recipe combines packet fruit jelly and evaporated milk. The evaporated milk must be “made really cold, and when you whip, it whips up like fake cream”. The fruit jelly is left in the fridge until almost set. Then you “fold those two things together, ending up with this flavoured mousse”. While Wood is known for flawless technique, his iteration of the dish is easy to make. He uses juiced strawberries for a more natural flavouring, but it still contains the all-important evaporated milk. His is a little lighter than traditional flummery, which can be “a bit on the spongy side rather than aerated”. The dish is currently off the menu, but is due another comeback when light spring fruit is back in season. Melbourne-based chef Victor Liong of Lee Ho Fook has also mined nostalgia on occasion. “A couple of years ago [at Chinese New Year] we cooked from the Australian Women’s Weekly Chinese Cookbook. It was good fun and really well received,” he says. “But I didn’t want to go down that route [every day].” This is because, for those who didn’t grow up around the many faces of Chinese cuisine, we are still in a period of discovery when it comes to Chinese cooking. “It hasn’t quite got around for people to be like, ‘I really want that nostalgic honey prawn’,” he says. There are exceptions. “Queen Chow in Sydney does a really good job doing that, but Dan Hong is obviously doing it with a pretty serious dim sum offering as well. It’s highbrow, lowbrow, I guess.” The Australian Women’s Weekly cookbook experiment had value for Liong because it helped explore stories of the Australian Chinese experience. “There’s a recipe in [that book] called I think, Billy Kee’s pork ribs.” He says the dish was “basically a sweet soy pork ribs-type dish”. But it was “named after this guy who had a Chinese restaurant and had a really, really interesting life … It’s cool to delve into that a little bit more, and try and tie that into what it looks like on our menu.” For Young, who also has a popular riff on pie floaters and devilled livers, the joy of reviving a retro recipe is subverting expectations. “I love the idea of taking things that have fallen out of relevance, and seem really bizarre and bunky, that wouldn’t seem appetising at all and then making them really approachable and really delicious.”"
Australian Border Force searched 822 phones in 2021 despite having no power to demand passcodes,2022-04-07T17:30:09Z,Josh Taylor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7m2v,"Australian Border Force officials searched 822 travellers’ mobile phones in 2021, despite admitting it has no power to force arrivals to give them the passcode to their devices. In January, Sydney software developer James told Guardian Australia that he and his partner were stopped on their return from Fiji by border force officials who asked them to write their phone passcodes on a piece of paper before taking the codes and their phones to another room to examine for half an hour. The phones were then returned and they were allowed to leave. Border force confirmed the practice was allowed under the Customs Act, but declined to expand on how often it was used, or what officers did with the devices once unlocked. In tabled responses to questions on notice from Labor’s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, border force confirmed that in 2021 – when international travel was still limited during the Covid pandemic – officers searched 822 devices at the border, out of more than a million arriving or departing travellers. In a written response to questions raised by the Greens digital rights spokesperson, Nick McKim, border force has confirmed there is no legal obligation for people to hand over their passcodes. “There is no legal compulsion for a traveller to provide a password/passcode or provide assistance to an electronic device at the border,” border force said. But if a person refuses to comply with the request and a border force officer considers there to be “a risk to the border” then border force can seize the device for further examination. There is no limit on time for how long the devices can be held for, but the agency said the policy is to keep devices for no longer than 14 days, unless it will take longer to examine the device. Border force said a phone would only be seized where officers suspect it has “special forfeited goods” such as “illegal pornography, terrorism-related material and media that has been, or would be, refused classification”. McKim said border force officials should be required to get a warrant before going through people’s phones. “It’s generally the requirement in Australia and it should be no different at the border,” he said. “Australia’s privacy protections need considerable strengthening so people’s phones aren’t examined on a hunch, or confiscated under the shadow of being referred to other authorities.” McKim said there needs to be more transparency from border force about what data had been collected from the searches, who has access to it and how it is stored. Border force said devices were scanned by another device, rather than manually checked by officers. “Only trained ABF officers will undertake examinations of electronic devices,” border force said. “The examination process involves the connection of the device to examination equipment and the review of the data stored on the device to determine a subsequent course of action.” Travellers cannot be present during the examination “for operational and security reasons”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning James, and others who expressed concerns about having their phones searched at the border, raised questions about border force officers going through their work files, or other items stored in the cloud and not on their device. Border force confirmed it does not have the power to access these files without a warrant. Border force said officers also have the power to make copies of documents related to any offence against a prescribed act, or information relevant to the work of Australia’s spy agencies. “Any copied information is stored securely and is subject to current ABF established security guidelines,” it said. “The ABF does not alter or delete any data as a result of an examination of a device under the Customs or Migration acts.” The data can be shared “depending on the type of information and the specific legislation that applies to that type of information”."
Craig Kelly billed taxpayers to fly to Melbourne anti-lockdown rallies ,2022-04-07T17:30:09Z,Christopher Knaus,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7n5v,"Craig Kelly is being investigated for billing taxpayers to fly to anti-vaccine mandate, anti-lockdown rallies in Melbourne, internal records show. Kelly, the leader of the United Australia party, charged taxpayers for his flights to and from Melbourne for two rallies in November and December last year, which were organised chiefly as protests against Victoria’s pandemic powers and the Victorian premier, Dan Andrews. The rallies were also used to protest Covid vaccination generally, particularly for children, and vaccine passports. Kelly was a prominent figure at both rallies. At the first protest, Kelly told the crowd that Australia was being “governed by medical bureaucrats that are part of a mad, insane cult” and said the UAP would “bring Daniel Andrews to his knees” after the next election. At the second rally, Kelly complained that he was unable to hire a rental car because he “refused to show his Covid-19 vaccine certificate” and said he was “no longer in a great city, I am here in a fascist medical state”. The Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Ipea) is probing whether Kelly, as a “backbench parliamentarian with a suburban Sydney electorate”, was allowed to charge taxpayers for the flights to Melbourne. It is also investigating his use of the government car service Comcar to travel from Melbourne airport on the day of the first rally. The watchdog began investigating Kelly’s travel after media reports about his speeches in Melbourne. “Upon investigation it was found that parliamentary business resources were used by Mr Kelly to travel to Melbourne on 13 November 2021 (returning same day) and on 3 December 2021 (returning 5 December 2021),” an initial assessment, released under freedom of information laws, found. “On the basis of the findings of this preliminary assessment, and in accordance with IPEA’s protocol on dealing with misuse of parliamentary work expenses, it is recommended IPEA proceeds with an assurance review into this matter to determine the dominant purpose of Mr Kelly’s use of travel resources.” The Guardian understands Ipea’s investigation is ongoing. Kelly said his travel was clearly parliamentary business. He said he had a private member’s bill before federal parliament on vaccine passports at the time, and was the leader of the UAP, speaking on national issues. “I was lobbying support for that [private member’s bill] across the nation,” he told the Guardian. “If that’s not parliamentary business, nothing is.” “If I was any member of parliament, such a large public rally would be parliamentary business that you went to it. The fact that I had a private member’s bill, or a couple of private members’ bills before parliament at that stage, I think makes it a direct [matter of parliamentary business].” “It wasn’t a conference on Hamilton Island or something like that.” Kelly said he had kept his costs down by flying economy to Melbourne and returning on the same day. “Sydney to Melbourne, Melbourne to Brisbane, I always fly economy, because I think that’s what the public would expect of a parliamentary backbencher,” he said. It is unclear how much Kelly charged taxpayers for the flights and Comcar. Ipea is yet to publicly release data for the last quarter of 2021 and the internal records do not show how much the flights cost."
Spiderbait celebrate bandmate Janet English: ‘She’s one of the greats of Australian music’,2022-04-07T17:30:08Z,Andrew Stafford,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mpp,"In the near-decade since Spiderbait last released an album, their bass player and singer, Janet English, has completed a bachelor’s degree in psychology. She’s not sure if she wants to practise. “I was just really interested in how the brain works,” she says. English is the owner of one of the most interesting brains in Australian music. At school, she excelled as a gymnast as well as at hockey, mime, theatre and art, before forming Spiderbait in 1991 with singing drummer Mark Maher (better known as Kram) and guitarist Damian Whitty (Whitt) in the Riverina town of Finley, New South Wales. Kram was an accomplished musician but, back then, English could barely make it from one end of a song to the other. “She’s kind of an accidental hero in a way,” Kram says. “She was a painter and artist who sort of stumbled into music through her friends and then discovered that she had these incredible talents.” Kram talks like he plays drums, at an overdriven mile a minute. English is more reticent. With Spiderbait marking their 30th anniversary last year, Kram had an idea: to celebrate English’s work in a single 33-track compilation, Songs in the Key of J. It features almost everything English has contributed to the band. That includes many of their most loved tunes, sung in English’s distinctively high and soft register: the acoustic-electric pop thrash of Calypso, the winking Fucken Awesome, and the glorious Jackson Five homage Stevie – songs that walked a tightwire of whimsy and cynicism, naivety and irony, humour and melancholy. It’s unusual for a group with three distinctive songwriters to release a single member’s work in one package. Most bands argue – and many break up – over songwriting credits, royalties and egos. But Spiderbait share everything equally, a trait of other bands with longevity on their side, including U2. English was not keen when Kram floated the idea but figured it would be one of many Spiderbait ideas that never came to fruition. “I have to credit Kram, he’s such a champion,” English says. “He’s an amazing musician but he’s so open to other people’s input, and respectful of what they bring to the table.” The band’s inclusive spirit was a product of the punk and hardcore scene from which they emerged. “We went and saw Dinosaur Jr in 1989 and they had a woman playing bass [Donna Dresch],” English says. “I think it was one of those nights where it felt like half of Melbourne tumbled out of the Prince of Wales [hotel] and went, ‘Let’s form a band.’” They quickly became indie-radio favourites and mainstays of the festival circuit. Their third album, Ivy and the Big Apples, released in 1996, went double platinum; its Kram-written lead single, Buy Me a Pony, topped the Triple J Hottest 100 poll, making Spiderbait the first Australian band to achieve the feat. The group pulled back a little after that. “I remember feeling like the gigs were getting out of hand, I was a bit over it all and I just wanted to retreat back into the studio,” English says. Their next album, Grand Slam, saw her dabbling with electronica and “all the pop stuff I grew up with in the late 70s and early 80s”. Sales dipped and, after 2001’s The Flight of Wally Funk, recordings became sparse: Tonight Alright, which featured their hit cover of Black Betty, was released in 2004, then nine years passed until a self-titled follow-up. Geography has played a part: English lives in Melbourne, Whitt in Ballarat and Kram near Byron Bay, where his home was just flooded. Kram says Songs in the Key of J is the second instalment of a trilogy of releases. The first was a reissue of Ivy and the Big Apples for its 25th anniversary. The third will be a new album, to be cut this year. “We’re having this beautiful renaissance on stage and we feel like we need to do the same thing on record,” Kram says. But for now, he says, it’s all about English. “She’s one of the greats of Australian music to me, and I think me and Whitt benefited from playing with her as much as she did with us,” Kram says. He draws a parallel with Magic Dirt’s Adalita, with whom Spiderbait played often: “The two of them are like the sun and the moon.” He describes Songs in the Key of J as akin to a solo album but in the context of Spiderbait. It’s probably the closest English will ever come to making one. “I’ve got creative control, I’ve got two amazing collaborators, so there hasn’t been that burning George Harrison post-Beatles desire to just show everyone,” she says. “I’ve been very lucky in that regard.” Songs in the Key of J is out now through Universal"
No Hard Feelings by Genevieve Novak review – another hot-mess-millennial novel,2022-04-07T17:30:08Z,Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7tde,"The lives of women in their twenties and thirties are ripe for unpacking: it’s a time of great change, personal epiphanies and coming into one’s own. Over the past few years, the enormous popularity of Sally Rooney and her ilk proves that there is a constant hunger for these stories, especially since the ugly truths and minutiae of women’s lives have historically been sidelined. From covers to content, “sad girl lit” is undoubtedly a current literary trend. It almost always centre on white, heterosexual, middle-class women; while their struggles are valid, they’ve got a lot to fall back on. Some of the books in this field are startlingly original and insightful – Meg Mason’s 2020 novel Sorrow and Bliss is a wry, intelligent exploration of living with mental illness – and some follow a more predictable trajectory of overcoming adversity to find contentment. Melbourne novelist Genevieve Novak’s debut No Hard Feelings slots neatly into the second category. It follows Penny Moore, a typical 26-year-old who lives in an inner-city sharehouse and works under a punishing micromanager at a digital marketing agency. She drinks too much. She spends endless hours swiping on dating apps. She is hopelessly in love with an ex-boyfriend, who sees her as a convenient hookup. Her longtime best friends are making strides in their lives: Annie is a lawyer with a promising new girlfriend, and Bec has recently become engaged. While once their trio seemed unbreakable, Penny feels as if she’s falling behind. The novel is a laundry list of Melbourne hotspots and cultural references: Novak namechecks inner-northern pubs and bars, indie bands and TV shows. The ex is a laughable cliche: a PhD student with a passion for Radiohead, vinyl, Doc Martens and op-shopped clothing. And the scenes at Penny’s workplace are excruciating in their replication of digital marketing jargon, especially when written in email form. If it weren’t so incredibly earnest, much of it could read as parody – and I say that as someone who is very much a part of this world. To Novak’s credit, she works some diversity into her novel in a way that mostly feels natural. Penny’s friends are queer and people of colour (facts mentioned only in passing or through implication), and there’s a self-awareness in the characters that reflects the shifting social tides. But this sometimes reads like shallow buzzword regurgitation, such as when Penny thinks: “I have such respect for an ethically sound company led almost exclusively by women, several of them women of colour.” Like so many women in so many of these books, Penny is a hot mess. She is a master of self-sabotage. Her inner monologue is often unkind, to herself and to others; there are various instances of fatphobia throughout the novel, and perhaps they are there to illustrate the vapid concerns of twentysomethings, but it is still uncomfortable to read. Penny’s solipsism is not unique – it’s largely the driving force of these very interior novels. But given the ubiquity of this kind of writing at the moment, it all starts feeling like white noise rather than profound insight. The rise of therapy among millennials makes its way into this novel in a way that’s more gratifying. Penny’s sessions with her psychologist Dr Minnick call to mind the patient-doctor relationship in the excellent television show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Dr Minnick’s dialogue sometimes reads like a self-help book, but Novak’s intent is admirable. There are many similarities to British author Dolly Alderton’s 2020 novel Ghosts, not least the fact that the elusive objects of both protagonists’ affections share a first name. Like Penny, Alderton’s narrator Nina finds herself casting unfair judgment on her friends in light of her own romantic failures. The contrast is that Nina’s journey ends not with romance, but acceptance that her life may not mirror the conventional path. Nina, though, is in her early thirties – what a difference a few years may make. While Penny concedes by the end of No Hard Feelings that rewards can be found in new beginnings, or simply living in the moment, and not only in fairytale endings, her happiness still comes from external sources: a steady boyfriend, a higher-paying job. Perhaps this is simply the reality of living under capitalism in the west – even when emotional peace is the goal, these traditional arbiters of success continue to signify a satisfying ending.

"What is Boris Johnson’s energy plan, and what is it missing?",2022-04-07T17:18:38Z,Rob Davies and Peter Walker,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p7t,"Boris Johnson claimed on Thursday that his energy security strategy had delivered “clean, affordable, secure power to the people for generations to come”. In comments issued as he launched the policy at Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset and put atomic energy front and centre of his plan, the prime minister said his government was the first for years that had not “dodged the big decisions on energy”. Yet within hours, critics spoke of a lack of ambition, particularly around onshore wind and energy efficiency, avenues that experts say offer the best and quickest hope of bringing down bills and achieving energy self-sufficiency. So what exactly is in the plan and what is missing from it? Nuclear Peak winter electricity demand is about 60 gigawatts and National Grid expects that to be 85GW by 2050, as vehicles and home heating are increasingly electrified, with a safety buffer needed on top of that. Johnson has set a target of 25% of electricity coming from nuclear. That means increasing capacity from 7GW to 24GW by 2050, an effort to be overseen by a new body, Great British Nuclear. The first phase will involve eight new nuclear reactors, equivalent to four 3GW power stations. Sizewell C is set for approval within this parliamentary term. Two more will follow in the next, with Wylfa on Anglesey the front-runner. After that, projects could be located at approved sites such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. Small nuclear reactors of nearly 0.5GW each will be part of the mix, with both Rolls-Royce and GE Hitachi working on projects. The recently approved “regulated asset base” funding model will transfer risk to the taxpayer, allaying risk-aversion among private firms, which has stymied recent development. Ministers have not ruled out taking a stake in individual plants. There will, however, be no nuclear power plants in Scotland, whose parliament has reaffirmed its opposition. Wind “We will be the Saudi Arabia of wind power,” the government claims. Offshore wind targets have been scaled up, from 40GW to 50GW, with planning reforms intended to cut delivery times, which can be up to 13 years. But Tory infighting has turned onshore into a sore point. A leaked version of the energy plan, first reported by the i newspaper, include a target of 45GW by 2035, up from nearly 15GW now. That disappeared in the final document, after anti-wind Tory MPs refused to countenance overhauling planning laws that make onshore all but impossible to develop in England. The government says it will look at offering local communities cheaper electricity bills in return for their consent but will not rip up those obstructive planning rules. No such prohibition exists in Scotland, which is better suited to onshore than England thanks to greater wind speeds and more remote locations. In a TV clip at Hinkley Point C, Johnson said onshore turbines were “controversial with people”. “People feel that they affect the beauty of the countryside, I totally understand that.” However, polling by YouGov in 2021 shows two thirds of people support onshore wind projects, even in rural areas. Solar Solar is in line for one of the biggest expansions. The plan envisages a fivefold increase that could take the total capacity from 14GW to 70GW by 2035. Unlike onshore wind, this could be underpinned by planning reform that favours development on non-protected sites. Energy efficiency The energy security plan contains no major new investment in upgrading leaky homes to make them easier and cheaper to heat, despite the price of gas – the heat source for 90% of homes – hitting historic highs. As recently as 2012, the UK was upgrading 2.3m homes a year thanks to government funding that was cut when David Cameron vowed to eliminate “green crap”, slowing the rate to a trickle. The energy security plan offers very little to reignite that drive to insulate the UK, enraging environmental groups. Oil and gas The government’s renewable proposals have been accompanied by firmer support for oil and gas, further inflaming the ire of environmentalists. North Sea drillers will be encouraged to seek new licences, although the government hasn’t quantified what impact it expects this to have on production. Having banned fracking in 2019, the government will commission an “impartial” review by the British Geological Survey into whether it can be done safely."
