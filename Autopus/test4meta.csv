The Masters 2022: Tiger Woods in action during first round – live!,2022-04-07T13:00:04Z,Scott Murray,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7m65,"Tiger rolls in a confident par saver, and that is a statement round of 71 for the almost super-human five-time champion! Did we really think we’d see this again after that harrowing car crash last year? But here we are. He’s just three off the lead ... and two behind his playing partner Joaquin Niemann, who makes his own par and signs for a 69. Meanwhile a bogey for Im on 10, the result of only just making it onto the front of the green with his second, the ball rolling back off down the fairway. He slips out of the lead and into a share of -3. A clumsy three-putt bogey for McIlroy on 6. He’s back to level par. Meanwhile back on 18, a break for Tiger, who got a friendly deflection off the branches and a free drop from his position wide left of the fairway. He’s able to force his second short right of the green. An up and down here would mean the world ... and an under par round. He whips a top-drawer wedge up the steep slope, over the bunker and onto the green from 70 yards to six feet. A chance to escape. As he walks up onto the green, he receives the sort of ovation some players would be lucky to get if they were about to win the whole thing. That’s real love. Smith absolutely skelps his long par putt up the 18th green. It trundles a good ten feet past. He can’t get the one coming back, and that’s one of the stranger rounds you’ll see in a while. Double bogey at 1, double bogey at 18, and a run of eight birdies in 12 holes in between. A disappointing end all right, but he’d have taken a 68 at the start of play. A four-over 76 for his partner Bryson DeChambeau, meanwhile, and that “par 67” around here remains elusive for one of golf’s more ambitious souls. -4: Smith (F), Im (9) -3: Willett (F), Niemann (17), Scheffler (16) Cam Smith looks likely to bookend his otherwise sensational round with misery. Having doubled 1, he’s in danger of repeating the trick on 18. He pushes his drive under the branches on the right, and clips them when he fires out. His third lands well short of the flag and spins back to the front of the green; he’ll have a tricky two putts for bogey. Meanwhile back down the hole, Tiger pulls his drive into trouble down the left. The wind is picking up, and it won’t be helping, I’ll be bound. Daniel Berger nearly scrambles a five. He chips up from the swale at the back of 18, landing delicately onto the fringe, the ball toppling down to four feet. But he doesn’t commit to his bogey putt, and that’s an awful way to end an otherwise excellent round. A double-bogey six, and all of a sudden that’s a much less sexy 71. He’s a lot happier than his playing partner Tommy Fleetwood, mind, who is signing for a three-over 75. It all came apart going into Amen Corner, as he pulled his second at 11 into the pond, a triple-bogey seven the ugly result. Not a great 24 hours for the staunch Evertonian, all told. The 2020 champion Dustin Johnson has been going along relatively quietly ... until now, when he rolls one in from 25 feet on 7. A second birdie of the day, and he rises to -2. Meanwhile Daniel Berger, who required a couple of up and downs at 16 and 17 to scramble pars, may be running out of road down the last. After slicing wildly into the trees on the 18th, then chipping out sideways in the medicine-taking style, he blades his third over the back and into the gallery. He’ll need a third top-class up and down in a row if he’s to limit the damage to bogey. Cam Smith knocks another approach close, this time at 17. But for once the birdie putt doesn’t drop, always staying on the high side. He taps in for a par that keeps him at -6. Some more missed putts: Will Zalatoris, having fired his tee shot at 6 straight at the flag, pulls a short uphill one, while Jordan Spieth, arrowing his second at the tightly positioned 5th to six feet, doesn’t commit again. They stay at -1 and level par respectively. Tiger needs something to happen after the dropped stroke at 14 and a tree-visiting par on 15. It happens! His tee shot at 16 isn’t all that, and he’s left himself a huge right-to-left swinger from 30 feet. In it goes, and he’s back into red figures at -1. Meanwhile on 17, it’s a second staunch up-and-down in a row by Daniel Berger, who leaves his bump up from the back of the green eight feet short, but rolls the putt in nervously. This round could easily have gotten away from Berger in the last 20 minutes or so; instead he’s hanging on in there, just three off the lead at -3. McIlroy had a birdie putt at 3 but left it short. He’s now got another at 4 ... and this one’s underhit as well, always dying off to the left. He nevertheless remains in good nick at -1. Meanwhile Im can only par the relatively easy par-five 8th, giving up a little ground to the field. He stays put at -4. Par for Danny Willett on 18, and he opens with a 69. That’s a fine effort - doubly so given his travails here since winning in 2016, missing five cuts in six appearances - and it puts him in the clubhouse lead. -6: Smith (16) -4: Im (7) -3: Willett (F), Berger (16), Niemann (15), Scheffler (13) -2: Kokrak (F), Schwartzel (10) Cam Smith sends his tee shot at the 170-yard 16th to five feet. This is outrageous. In goes the putt, and that’s his eighth birdie of the day, and his fourth in the last five holes. Eight birdies in 12 holes! Meanwhile on 4, a fairly frustrating bogey for Jordan Spieth. He pulls his tee shot at the par three miles left, and is faced with an almost impossible chip from 30 yards, up on a knoll. He lands his ball into the centre of the green, spinning it hard right, to five feet. It should be a sensational escape, right up there with Berger’s nonsense on 16, but he nervously shoves the short putt wide right. Back to level par. Spieth’s putter hasn’t been behaving of late. He’ll need to sort that out quicksmart. Cam Smith arrows his third at 15 to ten feet and rolls in his seventh birdie putt in 14 holes. What a round he’s having. What a round he’d be having had he not doubled the opening hole! He’s still only one shot in the lead, though, because Sungjae Im, who tied with the Australian for second spot here two Novembers ago, has just followed up his birdie-birdie-birdie start with another at 7. This course clearly suits both of these young players’ eye. Could this turn into a tussle for the ages? Meanwhile a sensational up and down by Berger, up a bank behind 16 and faced with a treacherous downhill chip and not much green to play with. He chips sideways, allowing the first cut to snag the ball, slow it up, and send it slowly trundling to par-salvaging distance. After a slow start to the round, a few players are really cooking now. -5: Smith (15) -4: Im (7) -3: Willett (17), Berger (16), Niemann (14), Scheffler (13) Guido Migliozzi led this tournament earlier in the day. A poor finish by the young Italian - bogeys at 13, 14 and 18 - has ruined all of his good work. A three-over 75. It’s a similar story for the two-time Open champ Padraig Harrington: an early share of the lead, a clumsy stumble home. Bogeys at 12, 16 and 17 mean he’s signing for a two-over 74. The 2015 champion Jordan Spieth, who nearly always contests for this championship, has also started well. Birdie at 2 has him at -1. Some big names also on -1 early in their round: Webb Simpson (6), Dustin Johnson (4), Will Zalatoris (3), Viktor Hovland (2) and Matt Fitzpatrick (2). But dropping back to level par: Tiger Woods, whose bump up from the back of 14 isn’t all that, and the six-footer he leaves himself is never dropping. A nice solid start for Rory McIlroy. Par at the opening hole, followed by a fine birdie at 2, the result of a delicate chip from the back of the green. He’s developed a habit of making awful cold starts at the majors in recent years, so this is somewhat refreshing. Early doors, though, so let’s not get carried away yet. He’s -1. An eagle putt on 13 stops just short for Tiger. He taps in for a birdie that moves him to -1. Then he flays his tee shot at 14 into the woods, but whistles an escape over the back of the green. He’s not too far from the flag, so par should be more than gettable from there. Meanwhile erstwhile leader Harry Higgs signs for a 71 and is the early clubhouse leader. Thanks Bryan. OK, it’s three birdies in a row for Daniel Berger, at 12, 13 and 14, and two birdies in three for 2016 champ Danny Willett, at 13 and 15, the latter another long-range right-to-left steer, like the 9th all over again. Throw in a birdie for Joaquin Niemann at 13, one for Scottie Scheffler at 12, and another for Cam Smith at 14, and there’s a whole new look to this leader board. -4: Smith (14) -3: Willett (16), Berger (14), Niemann (13), Scheffler (12), Im (6) -2: Kokrak (16), Champ (10), Schwartzel (9) Scheffler follows up a par save on the 10th hole with an even more impressive escape job on 11. The world number one follows a horrific second shot with a gorgeous up and down from 47 yards and a 10ft putt for one helluva four, keeping him within a shot of the pace at -2. ... and with that, it’s back to the inestimable Scott Murray. Woods saves par on the 11th thanks to a nifty bump-and-run putt with a six-iron that crawls within 5ft of the pin. A positively rammed gallery awaits on 12 and his reception is, as the kids say, a whole mood. That came moments after the Aussie Cameron Smith made birdie on 12 to join Im atop the leaderboard at -3 ... only 17 months after the pair tied for second in the 2020 tournament. There’s a new name on top of the leaderboard as Im Sung-jae opens his round with three consecutive birdies. He’s the first to go birdie-birdie-birdie to open an April Masters since Webb Simpson in 2014, although Christiaan Bezuidenhout, Xander Schauffele and Justin Thomas all turned the trick in November 2020. Elsewhere, Danny Willett birdies 13 to move within one of the lead. -3: Im (4) -2: Willett (14), Smith (11), Niemann (11), Scheffler (9), Schwartzel (7), Ancer (2) Woods, Niemann and Oosthuizen are making their way to Amen Corner after hitting their tee shots into the 11th fairway. Meanwhile, newly minted world number one Scottie Scheffler drains a 12ft putt on 9 for his second birdie in as many holes to move into a seven-way share of the lead at -2. ... and with that, I’ll hand you over to Bryan Armen Graham. Back in a bit! Travails for Woods, Niemann and Oosthuizen at 10. Tiger falls off the front of the green again. Niemann pushes into sand on the right. Oosthuizen goes long and left. All three hit their third shots to saveable distance, but only Tiger can salvage par. Niemann drops back into a share as a result. -2: Smith (10), Niemann (10), Schwartzel (5), Westwood (4) -1: Harman (14), Higgs (14), Willett (12), Berger (10), Scheffler (8), MacIntyre (5), Kanaya (4), Conners (4), Reed (3), Herbert (3), Nakajima -a- (3), Im (3) Tiger, having toppled back off the false front at 9, then witnessed his playing partner Niemann hole out from 105 yards, hits a heavy handed chip 12 feet past the flag. He does extremely well to tickle in a downhill par saver to remain at level par, three off Niemann’s lead. The defending champion Matsuyama cancels out that bogey at 3 with birdie on 8; he’s back to level par. And a birdie at 2 for the 2018 champ Patrick Reed, who joins a pretty big group bunched at -1. Lee Westwood is 48 years old now, so history is not on his side. While Phil Mickelson won the PGA last year at nearly 51 years of age, the oldest winner at Augusta is Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he did this ... ... but that’s not going to stop Westwood, a two-time runner-up here, having another go. He’s come out all guns blazing, with birdies at 2 and 3, and as you can see he’s part of the group at -2 (that no longer features Kanaya, who has bogeyed 4). Meanwhile a first birdie of the day for the world number one Scottie Scheffler, who nearly raked in a long eagle putt at 8 and moves to -1. Some top-quality effing and jeffing from Tiger on 9. He hooks into the trees down the left, but goes for the green anyway. He sends a low draw under the branches and onto the front of the green. However it’s always going to topple back off the false front and miles back down the fairway. “Aw fuckin’ hell!” Meanwhile compare and contrast: his partner Joaquin Niemann, from the centre of the fairway, wedges 20 feet over the flag, the spin pulling the ball back serenely into the cup. One of those that was always going in, en route from the moment it landed, bit and turned back. A hole out for eagle, and he jumps into the lead! -3: Niemann (9) -2: Smith (9), Schwartzel (4), Kanaya (3), Westwood (3) The 2011 champion Charl Schwartzel joins Kanaya in the lead at -2. Having already birdied 2, he draws gently into the par-three 4th and rolls the short birdie putt into the cup. And what’s this? The super-hot Cam Smith sticks his second at 9 pin high, leaving as straight a putt as you’re going to get on this famously treacherous green. In it goes from five feet - four birdies in five holes! - and we have a three-way tie for the lead! -2: Smith (9), Schwartzel (4), Kanaya (3) -1: Harman (13), Willett (10), Niemann (8), Champ (5), MacIntyre (4), Westwood (2) Tiger makes an awful horlicks of the par-five 8th. Statistically, it’s the easiest hole on the course, averaging 4.5789, having already given up 18 birdies today. Just the two bogeys ... until now. Tiger, from the centre of the fairway, sends a dismal second miles right of the green, fails to reach with his chip, then takes another three to get down. It’s a dreadful bogey and he is fuming. Back to level par he goes. A few minutes earlier, the Cam Smith resurgence continued apace, as he made his third birdie in four holes at 8, and rises to -1. Takumi Kanaya has played at Augusta once before, as a 20-year-old amateur in 2019. He made the cut that year, finishing tied for 58th, and now having turned pro and scraped into the top 50 in the world (he’s 49th) a second invitation to the Masters has been extended. The young Japanese prospect has grabbed his opportunity with both hands, flying out of the traps and making birdie at 1 and 2 ... and so, with Talor Gooch whiffing a chip from the side of 10, running up a double bogey to drop back to level par, the 23-year-old from Hiroshima is the new leader of the Masters! We waited 85 years for the first Japanese winner. Two in successive years? Why not? You know the rule about London buses. -2: Kanaya (2) -1: Willett (10), Smith (8), Woods (7), Niemann (7), Champ (5), Schwartzel (3), MacIntyre (3), Rose (2), Westwood (2) This time last year, Justin Rose opened with a 65. Having established a four-stroke first-round lead, the only way was down, and he finished the rest of the week with a pair of 72s and a 74. Throw in a late collapse in 2007, plus his famous but ultimately unsuccessful tussle with Sergio Garcia ten years later, and he’s got history here. Nobody has seriously mentioned the 41-year-old Englishman as a contender this week, but while he hasn’t got the form, he does have the knowledge, and he’s just steered in a tricky downhill right-to-left curler on 2 for a birdie that takes him to -1. Bob MacIntyre finished in a tie for 12th here last year. While he’s not been in the best form since, the 25-year-old from Oban remains the best chance Scotland has had to win a major since Colin Montgomerie was sat in the middle of the 72nd fairway at Winged Foot in 2006. Oh Colin! Anyway, birdie at 2 puts him into the big group in second spot ... alongside Harry Higgs, who has just shipped a shot at 11, falling victim to the super-enhanced swale to the right of the green. Talor Gooch - on debut at the age of 30 - is now out on his own. -2: Gooch (9) -1: Higgs (11), Willett (9), Berger (8), Woods (7), Niemann (7), Champ (3), Schwartzel (2), MacIntyre (2), Kanaya (1) Tiger loses his balance while driving at 7, sending his ball whistling into the trees down the right. He manufactures a slice back out, his ball stopping just short of the bunker guarding the front of the green. He screeches his chip to kick-in distance, and that’s an outrageous par save. He remains at -1 ... where he’s joined by the 2016 surprise package Danny Willett! The 34-year-old Yorkshireman follows up birdie at 8 with another on 9, slinging a big right-to-left downhill putt into the cup from 90 feet! That’s a stunner, and he hits the turn in 35! The first player to top the leader board at the 2022 Masters, the 1994 and 1999 champion Jose Maria Olazabal, ends the day with a 77. Ollie made the cut for the first time in seven years last April, but he’ll not be making it to the weekend this time round. He went round this morning with JJ Spaun, who only secured his invitation last week with his win at the Texas Open. After an emotional week, it looked as though the 31-year-old Californian was running on fumes after that long-awaited maiden PGA Tour victory - it was his 147th start - as he doubled 3 and bogeyed 4. But he steadied the ship impressively. Pars all the way home, with the exception of birdie at 13, and he’s round in 74. Not bad for a debut spin around Augusta. “I’ve seen the media in all its tawdry finery today, a competition between a lot of players reduced to a one-man snorefest. OK I like to know how Woods is doing, but TV and blogs are only in it for one man. I’ll come back when his round is over.” Roger Kirkby there, impressively typing and furiously wagging his finger at the same time, a motor-skills discipline that comes with a difficulty tariff of 5.3. Anyway, Tiger keeps on trucking, launching his tee shot at 6 straight at the flag, his second heat-seeking approach in a row. He’s not to be denied this time. He knocks in the two-footer he leaves himself, and moves into red figures for the first time this week. Tiger! Oosthuizen rakes in a long putt meanwhile to repair some of the damage of the previous hole. He’s +1. And it’s a birdie for Talor Gooch at 8. Suddenly the leader board has an all-new look to it. Shame Roger isn’t here to enjoy it. -2: Higgs (10), Gooch (8) -1: Woods (6), Niemann (6), Scott (4), Champ (2) Tiger whips his second at 5 from 220 yards to 15 feet. A glorious approach. He looks to have nailed the birdie putt, as well, and walks after it with the express intention of celebrating. Somehow, just as the ball hits the lip, it rolls around the edge of the cup and stays out on the left. That is preposterous, and surely not in keeping with the laws of gravity. Can we get a ruling? Nope. He taps in for his fifth par in a row. A double for Louis Oosthuizen, however, punishment for going over the back of the green and failing to give enough to his chip. The in-form Cam Smith came into this Tournament as one of the hot favourites. The new Players champion was runner-up here in 2020, and has another couple of top-ten finishes on his CV, but he didn’t start well today. His opening tee shot found a deep-faced fairway bunker, forcing him to chip out, then his approach went over the back. A double to begin, then just a par on the par-five 2nd, having found more sand from the tee. (Butch Harmon wondered on Sky whether the big stick would prove his undoing this week.) He’s repaired the damage however by chipping in from the side of 5, then nearly slam-dunking his tee shot at 6 straight into the cup! A tap-in for back-to-back birdies, and he’s level par again. A slow start by the defending champion Hideki Matsuyama. He sends his tee shot at 3 into the trees down the right, and is always out of position as a result. A bogey, and he’s +1 alongside some other former champs: Mike Weir (13), Zach Johnson (8), Danny Willett (6) and SANDY LYLE (1). On the subject of 1988 hero Alexander Walter Barr Lyle, Euan Hendrie (see Sandy entries passim) has sent me a screenshot from a betting site offering odds for Top Scot. Robert Macintyre is 1-100, while Lyle has been priced at a much more generous 11-1. “An outrage,” splutters Euan, tongue only partially in cheek. Time waits for no man, I guess. Tiger and Oosthuizen continue to par their way around Augusta. Niemann however makes it back-to-back birdies, arrowing his tee shot straight at the flag, leaving a ten-foot gentle right-to-left slider. In it goes, and he joins the group in second at -1, as does 2013 winner Adam Scott, who makes a fine up and down from the side of 2, rolling up with a fairway wood, and Tony Finau, who nearly drains an eagle putt on the same hole but makes do with a kick-in birdie. -2: Higgs (8) -1: MW Lee (9), Harman (8), Gooch (6), Berger (5), Niemann (4), Scott (2), Finau (2) It’s been a fairly steady ... borderline uneventful ... start to this Masters. The course playing long in the wet conditions, the wind, some tricky pins, and folk not wanting to play themselves out of contention early doors are all factors. It might not get much easier until the weekend, when the wind finally drops, the course dries out, and the committee place the flagsticks in a few more favourable conditions. Another fairly uneventful par for Tiger, this time on 3. It’s also a par-par-par start for Oosthuizen, but a birdie for the third man in the group, Niemann, who cancels out his opening bogey to return to level par. Up on 12, Harrington can’t get up and down from the bunker at the front of the famous par-three, and slips back to level par, but on the par-five 8th, Higgs knocks a wedge to three feet and tidies up for a birdie that gives him sole ownership of the lead! -2: Higgs (8) -1: MW Lee (8), Harman (8), Gooch (6), Berger (4) The wind is beginning to pick up at Augusta, as expected. Meanwhile one-man whirlwind Bryson DeChambeau came into this tournament under the radar, out of form and admitting that he’s only firing at about 80 percent of capacity. Birdie at 3 however means he’s joined the leading pack at -1. “Golf is sometimes unfair,” says Butch Harmon on Sky. Preach on, brother. Thankfully, Lowry’s stroke of bad luck at 4, finding himself faced with a tricky two putts for par after hitting a near-perfect tee shot, doesn’t cost the 2019 Open champion too much. He cradles his first putt up close, and tidies up to remain at +1. And he’s already made an ace at Augusta, on 16 in 2016, so life could be worse. Tiger takes a fairway wood off the tee at the par-five 2nd. Playing for position. He sends another just short front and right of the green, giving himself a good angle to attack the flag, tucked near the back left. His chip is overly conservative, though, and he can’t make the 15-foot birdie putt. Still, that’s a par-par start. Oosthuizen pars as well, getting up and down from a tight spot over the back, though there was a slight concern back up the hole when he grabbed the small of his back after hitting his second, and squatted down to rest awhile. Meanwhile the new world number one Scottie Scheffler has opened up with par. At the par-three 4th, Shane Lowry (+1) slam-dunks his tee shot straight into the cup ... nearly! Sadly it’s not a hole in one, because the ball rebounds off the base of the flagstick and a good 30 feet from the pin. So unlucky! He throws his iron to the floor in mock indignation, then flashes a wide smile and shares a laugh with his playing partner Kevin Na. That would have been just the second ace at 4 in the entire history of the Tournament, Jeff Sluman the only man to hole out, in 1992. Sepp Straka became the first Austrian to win on the PGA Tour when he won the Honda Classic back in February. He’s since chalked up a top-ten finish at the Players, and now on Masters debut he’s traversed the front nine for the very first time in style. Eight pars followed by a 20-foot birdie putt at 9. He hits the turn in 35 and joins a crowded group at -1 that now also includes Brian Harman, Daniel Berger and Tommy Fleetwood. (Harrington, incidentally, remains a member of this not particularly exclusive club with a fine up and down at 10, his second having toppled back off the false front.) -1: Harrington (10), Straka (9), Harman (6), Higgs (6), Gooch (3), Homa (3), Berger (2), Fleetwood (2) The sun comes out at Augusta. Almost as though the golfing gods know it’s lights-camera-action time for Tiger. Turns out his drive at 1 stopped just short of the bunker down the right, but he can still only find the front fringe of the large upward-sloping green. He chips up delicately, his ball making it up over two ridges but only just clinging onto the top level. He’ll have a straight uphill 12-footer for his par. In it goes, no problem. Meanwhile a two-putt par for Oosthuizen and bogey for Niemann, who could only splash out from a deep fairway bunker and paid the price accordingly. The leading pack fall back into the bunch. Guido Migliozzi doubles 7, having flayed his tee shot into the trees down the right. MW Lee drops a couple on 6, the latest to be fooled by the ridge along the middle of the green, a chip coming back to his feet. And it’s a three-putt bogey for Harry Higgs on 5. Meanwhile birdies for Talor Gooch and Max Homa on 2, plus back-to-back birdies for the 21-year-old amateur Austin Greaser, the runner-up in last year’s US Amateur behind James Piot, at 8 and 9, and it’s a five-way lead at the top. -1: Harrington (9), Greaser -a- (9), Higgs (5), Gooch (2), Homa (2) Amid bedlam at the 1st tee - albeit the sort of bedlam permitted at Augusta National - Tiger Woods makes his major championship comeback. He’s hit some nightmare opening drives at big tournaments through the years - OB, lost balls, the lot, even during his peak years - and this one isn’t the best, sneaking into a bunker down the right. He looks pained, but thankfully only in the spiritual sense. A lot of patrons following this match. They’re lining the fairway five, sometimes ten deep! God speed Louis Oosthuizen and Joaquin Niemann, going round in Tiger’s attention slipstream. Paul Casey’s long search for a maiden major will stretch on to Southern Hills and the PGA Championship next month. The 43-year-old Englishman, who has five top-ten finishes at Augusta on his resumé, plus two top-ten finishes in the majors last year (at the PGA and US Open) has been forced to withdraw with a back complaint. Migliozzi is joined at the top by the ever-entertaining Harry Higgs. The 30-year-old from Dallas is playing in his first Masters, having finished tied for fourth at Kiawah in last year’s PGA, and is very much part of the Barnes-Daly-Jimenez everyman tradition, as anyone who remembers him getting the old puppies out at the Phoenix Open a couple of months ago will attest. Having opened with bogey, he’s seized the day much as he embraces life, with birdies at 2, 3 and now 4. The young Australian Min Woo Lee, current Scottish Open champion, makes it three with a long birdie rake across 5. -2: Migliozzi (6), MW Lee (5), Higgs (4) -1: Harrington (8) Guido Migliozzi regains sole ownership of the early lead at -2 by rolling in a 20-footer for birdie at the par-three 6th. He’s going round with Garrick Higgo, who combines the earlier travails of Olazabal (failing to get his long putt over the ridge down the middle of the green, the ball rolling back to his feet) and antics of Harrington (rolling in a monster putt) for an entertaining bogey. He’s +1. A bit more on those sandwich-softening conditions. The aforementioned poor weather caused the start to be delayed by half an hour this morning, so use your mental arithmetic skills to recalibrate those tee times accordingly. The course will play softer and longer, spin accentuated on the greens, while a swirling wind could pick up as the day progresses. There’s not so much rain forecast for the rest of the week, though, so there’s plenty of time for the greens to dry out and act up in a very different way. Our man Andy Bull is in Augusta, and here’s his first dispatch from the trenches. “Morning from a slightly damp and dreary Augusta, where the clouds seem to be just beginning to clear and the sky’s getting a little lighter after two days of torrential rain, thunder and lightning (photo below). Just finished one of my favourite Masters traditions, the press conference with the Honorary Starters. Highlights this year included debutant Tom Watson’s exasperation at being asked whether he outdrove Gary Player even though he’s 14 years younger than him, and his trying to keep a poker face when he was asked if he had any advice for Phil Mickelson after his recent scandal (and their infamous bust-up at the Ryder Cup in Gleneagles), plus Player’s opinions on Cameron Smith’s mullet (“whatever a man wants to do, that’s freedom”) and how well dressed Indian women are (“I’m so used to seeing women with damn dresses up their bum and you don’t see anything like that in India”), and his insistence that he holds the record for the most consecutive rounds in which he’s scored lower than his own age, at just over 2000. Jack Nicklaus was in fine form too.” Some details on Padraig Harrington’s antics at the par-three 6th. Having shoved an awful tee shot 25 yards right of the green, he then sent a heavy-handed chip 67 feet past the flag. No matter! He tramlined the putt and it dropped to the biggest cheer of the week so far. (Yeah, yeah.) Tell you what, though, if there’s a more outrageous par save this week, we’ll be in for some top-drawer entertainment. Not a bad way to hold onto a share of the lead. Ah well, you can scrub that. Migliozzi’s tee shot into the par-three 4th only just finds the front of the green. He’s faced with a long two putts for par, and he can’t make them. Back he drops into a share of -1. He’s alongside another debutant, the 22-year-old South African lefty Garrick Higgo. He earned his place here this year with a win at the Palmetto Championship in South Carolina last June, in only his second start on the PGA Tour. He’s since missed the cut at the US Open, the Open and the Players, but that run in the majors has to stop sometime, and birdie at 1 won’t harm his chances. He’s now -1 through 4. -1: Harrington (6), Higgo (4), Migliozzi (4) To the top of the nascent leader board! The two-time Open champion Padraig Harrington was the first man to reach the heady heights of -2, with birdies at 3 and 4. But after sending his drive down the left of 5, he was only able to send his second onto the front edge of the green, from where he took three putts to drop back to -1. He’s now a shot behind the 25-year-old Italian Guido Migliozzi, who is playing here for the first time after qualifying thanks to his tie for fourth at last year’s US Open at Torrey Pines. Birdies at 2 and 3, and whatever happens from here on in, and admittedly there’s still a fair bit of golf to be played this year, he can always say he led the Masters. -2: Migliozzi (3) -1: Harrington (4), Higgo (4) The first shot of this year’s Masters was hit by the 1994 and 1999 winner Jose Maria Olazabal. That was quickly followed by this year’s first birdie: Ollie creamed a fairway wood pin high to 15 feet and rolled in the putt. It’s not been going quite so well for the 56-year-old Spaniard since then. Bogeys at 2, 4 and 5, and now a four-putt double-bogey at the par-three 6th, where the pin is high on the right-hand side of the green. Ollie sent his tee shot to the lower left, then couldn’t get over the ridge running down the middle, his long putt rolling all the way back to his feet. He’s +4 through 6. There’s only one place to start. Welcome to our live coverage of the 86th edition of the Masters Tournament. Here’s a snippet from last year’s first-round preamble … [Tiger’s] awful accident means he won’t be here this year; here’s to the great man rebuilding his health and completing yet another fairytale comeback. A sixth Masters in 2022? Hey, we’re allowed to dream. Did we really believe what we were writing back then? We can’t have been serious. Was the heart ruling the head? Not sure. But here we are! We’ll be keeping close tabs on the five-time winner this morning as he attempts a comeback for the ages that would make 2019’s comeback for the ages look like a walk in the park. We make no apologies for doing so. You’ll have to sue us. It’s just the way things have to be. Other players are available, though! The favourite going into the week is reigning US Open champion Jon Rahm, aiming to become the fourth Spaniard to pull on a jacket in Pantone 342. Justin Thomas, the one and only player in the field that’ll be getting beneficial advice from Tiger, if you believe Rahm, is not far behind in the betting. A second major is long overdue for the 2017 PGA champ. Cameron Smith and Scottie Scheffler are the hottest properties on the PGA Tour this season. Smith has a sensational record at Augusta – three top-ten finishes in five starts, including a tie for second a couple of Novembers ago. Scheffler has yet to make a mark here, but he is the new world number one, so there’s that. Sam Burns is another man in form, though he’s never played here before, and nobody has won here on debut since the club dropped their insistence on everyone using local caddies. You gotta know where to miss, see, as Bernhard Langer told Bryson DeChambeau the other year. The 2020 champ Dustin Johnson is coming back into form. Rory McIlroy and Collin Morikawa could be dangerous if either get their erratic putters going; ditto Viktor Hovland with that wedge of his. Brooks Koepka usually shows in the majors; Jordan Spieth always shows at Augusta. Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Will Zalatoris have all had near misses here, and are good to come again. And of course there’s the reigning champion Hideki Matsuyama, bidding to become the first player since Tiger in 2002 to successfully defend his title. We could go on for some time – Bryson! Bubba!! Sergio!!! - but what would be the point? There aren’t too many no-hopers in this field. So make yourself a pimento cheese sandwich, pour a long cool glass of iced tea, pine for the legendary Georgia Peach Ice Cream Sandwich (missing this year due to supply-chain issues) and settle down. We’ll get going here at 3pm BST, which translates as 10am in Georgia. Until then, here are the tee times.

"Braga v Rangers: Europa League quarter-final, first leg – live!",2022-04-07T18:00:09Z,John Brewin,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z95,"64 min: Early involvement for Roofe, but he slips on to Aribo’s pass and handles it as he falls in the box. There’s a very weak attempt to claim a penalty. 62 min: And here they come, how might they affect the play now that Rangers have come back into the game? On come Barisic, Roofe and Aribo, off come Balogun, Sakala and Jack. A reshuffle is in place and each of those players have not had the easiest nights. 60 min: Rangers changes imminent is the word... 59 min: Braga try to re-establish dominance but Rangers have regained their shape, and kept it tight. Braga are reduced to passing the ball around in non-dangerous areas. 57 min: Arfield tries to charge down Matheus but ends up being tricked by the goalie, not that it won’t have sent shivers down the spine of Braga’s fans. It was risky. Fabiano also fouls Kamara, and that results in a free kick that comes to Arfield to swing at. The ball is cleared away. Rangers with momentum? Possibly. 55 min: From nowhere, Rangers get a corner, and Tavernier must do better with this one. Abel Ruiz climbs highest to head clear for Braga. 54 min: Couto continues to cause havoc, and Rangers continue to struggle get the ball clear and up. They are defending well at the moment but need to maintain their concentration. 52 min: Kamara is trying his best to get on the ball but Rangers are struggling to make the ball stick at the moment; nobody is holding it for long. That sets up myriad Braga attacks, and allows them to control possession. 50 min: Lundstram forces the ball down the field, with Braga pushing hard on to Rangers players. It feels like there are more Braga players on the field at the moment. 48 min: Medeiros, Couto and Orta carve some pretty patterns with their passing; Braga are a quality outfit. Couto, who is giving the Rangers left flank a terrible chasing, wins a corner, though one cleared easily. 46 min: Back away we go, no Rangers changes, no Aaron Ramsey. You remember him, Aaron Ramsey, good for Wales. After starting so well, Rangers began to cough up chances and having escaped a VAR-assisted goal, Abel Ruiz struck. In the dressing room, Gio has work to do to work out how to prevent those pacy counters. There is potential gold amid Braga’s shaky defence if Rangers can step forward a bit more. 45+3 min: Gomes, clearly feeling better, speeds past Tavernier then Kamara, showing off what is a clear talent. 45+2 min: Arfield, Jack and Lundstram are chased down in the corner. Braga’s energy is winning out here. 45 min: Rangers build up an attack then ends with a John Lundstram shot, only for an offside flag to be waved. Four minutes added on to this half. 44 min: Braga are a man down as Gomes has taken a knock jumping up for the ball on the touchline. He’ll be OK to continue but takes his time. 42 min: Braga had come more and more into it, finding space down the wing, with Couto against Kent something of a mismatch for Kent’s defensive capabilities. Poor defending from Balogun, who sticks out a leg as a pass from the excellent Couto finds the striker who smashes it beyond Allan McGregor and in. No VAR this time, a fine goal but one that could have been far better defended. 39 min: Rangers sitting back a little bit more, and having to be wary of the excellent Couto. 37 min: A break in play as Ryan Jack takes a knock. He looks a tad roughed up. 36 min: Matt Burtz is in: “I’m aware that Max Rushden describes you as music hipster, but what’s wrong with Def Leppard? Personally, I could usually use more Def Leppard in my life.” Nothing, I had Pyromania on just this morning. Great band, nice blokes, proper Sheffield. I saw them promote When Love And Hate Collide at Bramall Lane in 1995, hence the reference. 34 min: Zakala turns Tormena and has time and space to shoot. He wastes what is his best chance so far. The Braga defenders are not the quickest. 32 min: Ryan Kent scampers away, and looks to have found his way through, only for Couto to quell the danger. Yan Couto, by the way, is on loan from Manchester City, having already played for sister club Girona. 31 min: Braga force a corner from one of those wildcat attacks but Rangers scramble it clear, looking far less sure of themselves as they did 15 minutes ago or so. Ricardo Orta is a growing force in this game, as are Medeiros and Couto. 28 min: A let-off for Rangers, they had let their guard down, and allowed Braga space and time in their box. Ryan Jack was taken out in the melee from which Orta scored, and went down. The ref ran off to the TV screen to check and we all know what that means. Back to parity. The goal came from a similar position as the previous chance, Couto down the wing, a couple of chances to clear the ball go begging, and off Tavernier, the Braga skipper buries it... 24 min: Braga smash the post! A speedy break. Ricardo Horta smashes the ball after a Couto cross from the flank causes chaos. It comes off the post and back out when he might have done better with his finish. 22 min: Braga’s Carmo is booked for clattering Kamara, whose speed from deep is causing problems. Tavernier takes the set piece and makes a mess of it again. He needs to do better, the skipper, on those dead balls. 21 min: Braga, having to take a breather after being given something of a buffeting by Rangers, choose to rest on the ball with some gentle passing. 19 min: Rangers free-kick from the left after Kamara is bundled over, Tavernier’s kick smashes off the face of someone in the wall. Rangers keep up the pressure. 18 min: Rangers have most of the ball but need be wary of opponents whose young, zesty legs make them ideal for the speeding counter. 16 min: Sakala climbs but Carmo, Braga’s hulking defender, climbs higher and stronger. 15 min: Desperate defending from Braga’s Al Musrati as Sakala is played the ball in a dangerous position in the six-yard box. Rangers stepping this up, looking to have far more threat. 13 min: Sakala is sent down the right, and he looks to have the beating of his opposing full-back for pace, though this time hits the first defender. More glimmers of hope for Rangers. 12 min: Braga need to gain back control here, Rangers keep winning back possession, though they too have been a little wasteful. This game continues to be wide open. 10 min: A jink from Kent and a pass out wide Arfield opens up space. Rangers have a route through the Braga defence, it seems. Time to exploit that. 9 min: It looks like Matheus, the Braga goalie, may no longer be able to carry on, having hurt himself in that Kent half-chance. Looks like a muscle problem. He says he is OK to carry on, but is limping. The advice to Rangers plays now is to shoot on sight. 7 min: This is an open game. Both of them pressing hard, going at each other. Peter Oh joins us: “Re: the rock face on one end of the Braga ground. I would love to see Granit Xhaka play on this pitch, blooter a crushing shot well over the crossbar, with the ball bursting from the impact with the sheer cliff.” 5 min: Chaos in the Braga box. Arfield takes the ball from Goldson and the ball is good, then Kent storms in but his first touch is a little too high. He might have done better there and Matheus in the Braga goal came out to smother the ball and didn’t exactly look the bravest. 4 min: Braga pushing on. Medeiros, for whom nothing’s gonna change my love, gets down the right side, cuts in and is blocked off. Already, they look a decent quality opponent for Rangers. 2 min: A speeding Ryan Kent almost gets down the right, but Braga clear and attack with speed of their own. Goldson has to step out to clear the danger. Both teams favour speedy attacks, we can safely say. 1 min: And away we go in Portugal, where the atmosphere is bouncing, the home fans really turning it on. The three-sided ground reminds of the Bramall Lane of the 1990s, but with a bit more atmosphere, nicer weather and a bit less Def Leppard and Dave Bassett. Allan McGregor is making a century of European appearance tonight, the 40-year-old veteran who didn’t have the best Old Firm match at the weekend. Ok, here we go in the quarter-final, with Rangers having travelled further in the competition than any other Scottish club; they reached the final of the old Uefa Cup in 2008 under the late, great Walter Smith. These two met in this competition two years ago, back in the days of Stevie G. Rangers should have extended the 3-2 lead with which they travelled to Portugal during the first half but wasted three chances – with Ianis Hagi becoming their fourth player this season to miss a penalty. But Kent sealed Rangers’ place in the draw on Friday 16 minutes after the break to send the 5,000 fans who had journeyed from Scotland wild and now Gerrard hopes it will help the Englishman return to his best. Gio van Bronckhorst speaks to BT in Braga. Big opportunity, great to be involved in Europe still. We have one goal to go to the semis. Disappointment’s a big part of footbal;, especially when you lose to Celtic. The focus was switched to today. You want to see a reaction, a desire, we have a big squad, and it’s a tie over two games. [Braga]’s a good team, you don’t beat Sheriff and Monaco if you are not a good team. We have to be ready. Nice view of an amazing stadium. More from Carlos Carvahal, speaking to BT about those youngsters. He loves to talk. They are not afraid of anything, they want to fight. So far the team is growing since the start of the season. I am very happy with team. The Scottish fans starts the party already, the Braga fans will come a bit later. I think it will be a fantastic game. All the teams in he world have weak points and we will try to exploit the weak points of Glasgow Rangers. Some quotes from the Braga manager, Carlos Carvahal, via the BBC. We’ve got the youngest team left in the Europa League. We have a lot of boys with very good quality. David Carmo was linked last year with Liverpool. We have a lot of talented players aged 17, 18, 19 who want to play in England. They now have a good opportunity to show their abilities to the clubs across the world. Braga is the stadium where one side of the pitch faces a cliff wall, it’s one of the most picturesque places to visit in Europe. But what other cultural delights might the Rangers faithful have found? There’s contemporary photography in the Museu da Imagem, which spans two historic buildings: one from the 19th century and a tower from the 14th that was part of the original city wall, and innovative design at the Chapel Tree of Life (open to the public Fridays at 5pm) within the centuries-old seminary of São Pedro and São Paulo. This slatted structure, constructed solely of wood (with no nails or hinges), is suffused with light and evokes the serenity of the nearby forests while providing a singular example of the power of modern architecture. Braga’s social media team have chosen a rather Tolkienesque font. What does that mean? Aaron Ramsey was supposed to start but doesn’t, and drops to the bench alongside Joe Aribo and Kemar Roofe, while Glen Kamara, Scott Arfield and Fashion Sakala come in. There’s talk that Gio Van Bronckhorst has opted for a back three, and it does look like a hard-working, more defensively minded team. To quote Rangers’ website: That means it’s a back five of Allan McGregor in goal with James Tavernier, Connor Goldson, Leon Balogun and Calvin Bassey in front of him. Kamara joins John Lundstram and Ryan Jack in the middle of the park, while up front, Arfield and Ryan Kent will play in support of Fashion Jr. Braga: Matheus, Y. Couto, Fabiano, Tormena, Carmo, Al Musrati, Medeiros, A. Horta, R. Horta, Ruiz, Gomes Subs: Hornicek, Sa, Buta, Leite, P. Oliveira, Rodrigues, Castro, B. Cuoto, Mineiro, Moura, Fale, V. Oliveira Rangers: McGregor, Tavernier, Goldson, Balogun, Bassey, Jack, Lundstram, Kamara, Arfield, Sakala, Kent. Subs: McCrorie, McLaughlin, Wright, Barisic, Davis, Aribo, Sands, Ramsey, Diallo, Roofe. Last Sunday hurt for Rangers. When Aaron Ramsey scored that early goal against Celtic, all seemed to be going to plan only for things to fall apart and the title race may be all but lost. And then there was that unpleasantness with bottles being thrown. Still, Europe has been a sanctuary for Rangers this season, away from the pain of losing Steven Gerrard and a distraction from domestic matters. Braga, who reached the final of this competition back in 2011, are coming off a 3-2 win over Benfica at the weekend, and sit fourth in the Portuguese Liga table behind the three traditional powers. Of course, Rangers will have to do this without Alfredo Morelos, ruled out for the season, and come up against a familiar face in Carlos Carvahal, once of Swansea and Sheffield Wednesday, who is in charge of the youngest team in the competition. Portugal is always a crucible of talent, so could be some stars of the future on show. Not that Rangers will be admiring the talent, going as far in the competition as possible is the aim. Kick-off is at 8pm UK time. Join me."
"West Ham v Lyon: Europa League quarter-final, first leg – live!",2022-04-07T18:00:09Z,Tim de Lisle,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zac,"60 min: Play stops for the right reason as Fredericks needs some attention after a clash of heads with Dembele. He seems OK, happily. 57 min: Yet another long-range shot from Lyon – better than most, as Ndombele lashes a drive past the post. 55 min: Credit too to Pablo Fornals, who did well to half-force the error from Boateng by pressing high and hard. 53 min: It was a mistake by Boateng, who allowed the ball to bobble through to Bowen. He would have been offside but was saved by Boateng’s touch. And the finish was nice and calm, into the corner. The crowd, who had been feeling very sorry for themselves, have come alive again. What the hell! 46 min: West Ham were already playing a low block, so not much has changed as yet. But their problem is that when they hoof it long to Antonio, he now has nobody to flick it on to. West Ham are out early for the second half. Ben Johnson has come on to replace Cresswell, and Benrahma has been sacrificed, which is a shame as he was playing well. The wink has already been shown about six times. And rightly so in my humble opinion, because the incident did seem to be part of a pattern. Several times, a Lyon player had gone down softly, or stayed down implausibly. And the ref had let them get away with it. “I want West Ham to win,” says Adam Berry, “but I don’t see the controversy around that sending off. Cresswell has got his eyes on the man, Dembele has the run on him, Cresswell clearly tugs his shoulder, and if it happened in the middle of the pitch it’d be a clear foul and yellow. It’s the right call in my opinion. “The wink was equally parts infuriating and hilarious though.” “I’ve got to say,” says Nick Jones, “if that was a straight red, I’m a banana. Watching this on holiday in Mallorca, with a lot of unhappy WHU fans. Quite mad.” Are there any Lyon fans in the house? They might well agree with you. On a happier note, here’s Joe Pearson in Indianapolis. “I thought,” he says, “it was THE LAW that all musical references in West Ham MBMs must be Iron Maiden related. Or maybe we’ve just entered a brave new world.” You wait 45 minutes for something to happen, and then it’s a shocker. As Cresswell got his straight red, a camera zoomed in on Moussa Dembele – who was winking. This match may have been ruined before it has even got going. 45+5 min: Lyon waste the free kick, but pick up a corner. It’s been a long two minutes. This is highly controversial. Dembele was away, Cresswell did get a touch with his hand, but the red card seems very harsh. 45+1 min: We’re into the first of two added minutes. 45 min: West Ham spend a minute in Lyon’s half, for once, and get their reward as Bowen wins a free kick on the right wing. Lyon clear it easily enough. 41 min: Declan Rice makes a mistake! He aims a back header, down into the ground, and doesn’t get enough on it, allowing Lyon to take another of their long shots – which brings only a corner. West Ham break with Benrahma down the left. He thinks he’s won a corner too, but the ref gives a goal kick. 39 min: Lyon go back to the patient build-up, which seems to be their default. West Ham escape with the long ball. Emerson and Fredericks go for a 50-50 and end up nose to nose. The words “Fuck you” may have been uttered (by Emerson). “I hope you’re well!” says Adam Kline-Schoder. Can’t complain. “I am watching the Eintracht Frankfurt-Barcelona match -- since you didn’t ask: 0-0 but Piqué is off injured already and Frankfurt should really be 2-0 up -- and am keeping tabs on the West Ham-Lyon game through your MBM. I saw the photo at the top of the page, and it got me thinking: why do teams change their kits for European competition? West Ham’s shorts are usually white at home but here are claret (I believe Leicester do the same with blue), and Manchester City have their weird digital numbers on their Champions League kits. Is that unique to British teams? Is it sponsorship nonsense? Enquiring minds (read: my mind) want to know.” I’m not sure! So I’m throwing it out to the floor. 36 min: There’s a delay as Jerome Boating gets some treatment for what looks like cramp, odd as it may sound. 32 min: We have another shot on target! From Declan Rice, not tumbling but taking part in a training-ground corner routine. He has to take it with his left foot, and it’s the opposite of that shot from Ndombele: precision without power. West Ham then win another corner, only to do nothing with it. 30 min: A third of the game has somehow slipped by. Lyon have had twice as much of the ball as West Ham, but have also conceded the only shot on target. An email! From Peter Oh. “I suppose West Ham and Rolling Stones fans reckon that it’s only the Europa League, but they like it.” Ha. “Now that you’ve mentioned the Stones having played this ground, I’ll be keeping a close eye on Declan Rice whenever he approaches the Lyon box. If he goes down too easy, I’ll be forced to make a Tumbling Rice joke. In any event, it’s nice to see the visitors play with Gusto.” 28 min: A free kick to West Ham, chipped into the box, but it leads only to a free kick for Lyon as Gusto goes down. 26 min: Lyon go back to knocking it around. Eventually Ndombele gets bored and has a crack from 25 yards – all power and no precision. 23 min: Suddenly it’s end to end as Lyon answer another long ball from West Ham with one of their own. As usual, nothing comes of it bar a feeble appeal for a penalty as Fredericks stops Auouar in his tracks. 20 min: Dembele runs onto a through ball, and he’s probably onside, but Areola is alert to the danger and gets a booming clearance in. 18 min: Lyon have a promising attack, but it ends with West Ham coming close. Rice, clearing up after a poor cross, picks out Antonio, who flicks on, then gets the ball back in the inside-right channel. Again, though, the angle is too tight. 16 min: West Ham come alive! It’s another long ball, but a pinpoint one, from Dawson. Benrahma controls it on the run and gets a firm shot away, but the angle is too tight. 14 min: The game has developed a pattern: patience and latticework passing from Lyon, long balls and high pressing from West Ham, cutting edge from neither. 9 min: A shot! From a Lyon player – about 30 yards out, instantly blocked. But they are warming up, and they play their first threatening cross, whipped in from the left, well defended by West Ham. 8 min: You know how some matches set off at a thunderous pace? This is not one of them. 7 min: Lyon make it into the box, with Dembele holding the ball up well, Lukaku-style, but again the final ball is poor. 5 min: Gusto, Lyon’s pacey right-winger, has plenty of time to get a cross in, but he overcooks it. 3 min: Lyon are being leisurely, West Ham more direct. Antonio gets his head on a punt from Areola but can’t quite find Bowen with his flick-on. 1 min: Lyon get the party started with some neat little passes. Declan Rice bumps fists with the Lyon captain – Moussa Dembele. Rice needs to avoid a yellow if he wants to play in the second leg. West Ham have won their last four at home in all competitions, their best such sequence for ten years. But then Lyon have won their last six away matches in the Europa League. Something’s gotta give. The crowd are absolutely loving it. The London Stadium is rocking as it hasn’t rocked since the Rolling Stones played there a few years ago. Bubbles are being blown. And sung. David Moyes is talking to BT, sounding calm. “Slightly different game,” he says, “It’s the first leg. We’d like to win, but it’s not settled tonight.” He says he picked Ryan Fredericks (over Ben Johnson) partly because of the pace of Karl Toko-Ekambi – who, as he doesn’t add, is on the bench. Lyon (4-2-3-1?): Lopes; Gusto, Boateng, Lukeba, Emerson; Mendes, Ndombele; Faivre, Paqueta, Aouar; Dembele. Subs: Pollersbeck, Da Silva, Denayer, Barcola, Henrique, Dubois, Reine-Adelaide, Barcola, Kadewere, Tete, Toko-Ekambi. West Ham United (4-2-3-1): Areola; Fredericks, Dawson, Zouma, Cresswell; Soucek, Rice; Bowen, Benrahma, Fornals; Antonio. Subs: Fabianski, Johnson, Coufal, Masuaku, Diop, Alese, Noble, Kral, Perkins, Randolph, Vlasic, Yarmolenko. Evening everyone and welcome to West Ham’s biggest European game since ... well, I make it 1981. That one didn’t go too well: after storming into the quarter-finals of the Cup-Winners’ Cup, they went and lost 4-1 at home to Dinamo Tbilisi. But that was then, so long ago that one of their regulars was Frank Lampard (Senior). And this is now, when they’ve just seen off Sevilla, who pretty much own the Europa League. Manchester United, eat your heart out. David Moyes is not only looking down on United in the league table: he’s still in Europe and they’re not. But he won’t be allowing himself much of a gloat because his team face a tricky assignment here. At 538.com, Nate Silver’s prediction machine, West Ham are favoured to make it through this round, but only by 55 per cent to 45. Lyon waltzed through their group, winning five games and losing none. Last time they came to the UK, in September, they beat the mighty Rangers. They’re erratic in Ligue 1, where they lie ninth, but efficient in the Europa: in the last round, against Porto, they won 1-0 away before drawing 1-1 at home. It could be the loudest night at the London Stadium since the win over Sevilla. Kick-off is at 8pm, so I’ll be back soon after 7 with the teams."
‘So much joy’: Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation lauded as ray of hope,2022-04-07T19:41:21Z,David Smith in Washington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pze,"Politicians and activists kept coming back to one word on Thursday after the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court: joy. After two grim years of a deadly pandemic and a democracy in peril, Jackson’s ascent as the first Black woman to serve on the nation’s highest court was lauded as a much-needed ray of hope. “Judge Jackson’s confirmation was a historic moment for our nation,” tweeted Joe Biden, posting a photo of himself with Jackson after they watched the Senate’s 53-47 bipartisan vote on TV. “We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America. She will be an incredible justice, and I was honored to share this moment with her.” Democratic senators stood and applauded in celebration. Cory Booker, a member of the Senate judiciary committee who is African American, said in a statement: “Like many Americans, I feel immense pride and so much joy at this historic occasion. “As Judge Jackson ascends to the United States supreme court, I see in her the affirmation of our ancestors who suffered the indignities of this country yet sacrificed to bend the moral arc of our nation towards justice. They knew that America, though haunted by its past failings, was not bound by them and believed that a day like this would eventually arrive.” The sentiment was echoed by Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She said: “This is truly a joyful day for the country. Judge Jackson is one of the most experienced nominees in decades.” Jayapal acknowledged the partisan attacks by Republicans during Jackson’s confirmation process, including misleading questions about her sentencing of child abuse images offenders and views on critical race theory. “The country saw her poise, grace, thoughtfulness, and brilliance as she handled every part of the confirmation process – including some outrageous attacks from Republican senators that damaged only their credibility, not hers,” she added. Jackson’s status as the first African American female justice in the 233-year history of the supreme court was also hailed by civil rights organisations, which pointed to its symbolic power for future generations of Black girls who will see her in school textbooks. Janette McCarthy Wallace, general counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said: “Today, Black women truly are supreme. Over the past few weeks, it has been an incredible privilege to bear witness to the rise of the first Black woman supreme court justice. “The significance of this moment for the Black community, especially for Black women like me who have spent decades in the legal profession, is tough to overstate.” Wallace added: “Representation is powerful – now, Black women and girls who dream of reaching the highest levels of our government can see that it is possible. While soon-to-be Justice Jackson’s confirmation did not come without racist, misogynistic attacks on her career and character, it is without question that Ketanji Brown Jackson is eminently qualified to serve on the supreme court of the United States.” Amanda Brown Lierman, executive director of Supermajority, a women’s equality organisation, added: “This is a historic moment for all women, but especially for women of color. Representation matters, and little Black girls everywhere will finally be able to see themselves represented on the highest court of the land. “I could not be more proud to have Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on the bench. I will be celebrating her with my three daughters today, and every April 7 will be Ketanji Brown Jackson day in our house.” Republicans were unrepentant about their opposition to Jackson. Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican national committee, said: “Biden’s pick Ketanji Brown Jackson is a radical, activist judge, one who failed to answer simple questions on her record, including leniency for child porn offenders and support of CRT. “Jackson has proved to be in lockstep with the far left’s political agenda, even refusing to define what a woman is.” But the vote represents a rare victory for progressives after years of setbacks and bitterly divisive hearings that saw conservatives on the court gain a 6-3 majority that will remain unchanged. Barack Obama, America’s first Black president, tweeted congratulations to Jackson and wrote: “This is a great day for America, and a proud moment in our history.” Meagan Hatcher-Mays, director of democracy policy for the grassroots movement Indivisible, said: “It’s not often we can describe a Senate vote as ‘joyous’, but that’s exactly what this was – for the first time in the supreme court’s 233-year history, a Black woman will serve as a justice.”"
Russia-Ukraine war latest: Kremlin admits ‘significant’ troop losses; Russia suspended from UN human rights council – live,2022-04-07T04:28:26Z,"Maanvi Singh (now);  Joanna Walters, Léonie Chao-Fong, Martin Belam and Samantha Lock (earlier)",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mt3,"The US congress has approved one measure to remove Russia’s “most favored nation” trade status and another to ban oil imports from Russia. Joe Biden is expected to sign both measures into law. The measure amending Russia’s trade status clears the way for the Biden administration to raise tariffs on Russian imports. “Putin must absolutely be held accountable for the detestable, despicable war crimes he is committing against Ukraine” said senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “This package is about bringing every tool of economic pressure to bear onVladimir Putin and his oligarch cronies, said Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “Putin’s Russia does not deserve to be a part of the economic order that has existed since the end of World War Two.” Also in the committee hearing in Washington on Thursday, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said that Moscow has, essentially, stopped taking Washington’s calls on military matters and there had been no dialogue between the two countries since mid-February. “We’ve not been very successful because the Russians have not responded,” Austin said, declaring himself disappointed at the situation. But he added: “Based upon what they’ve done, nothing surprises me. And it doesn’t mean that we’ll stop reaching out to engage them Austin chimed with Milley on grim prospects for the south-east of Ukraine at this point. But he asserted that Russian president Vladimir Putin has given up on capturing the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. “Putin thought that he could very rapidly take over the country of Ukraine, very rapidly capture this capital city, he was wrong,” Austin said. He added: “Putin has probably has given up on that.” The top of the US military top brass testified in Congress earlier on Thursday and the head figure of General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had grim warnings for the millions desperately hoping Russian president Vladimir Putin sees sense and stop the attack on Ukraine. “Ideally, Putin decides to cease fire, stops his aggression, and there’s some sort of diplomatic intervention, but right now that doesn’t look like it’s on the immediate horizon. It’s going to be a long slog,” Milley told the US Senate armed services committee in a hearing in Washington, DC. Bearing in mind that regional leaders are begging remaining residents in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine to leave while they have a “last chance” before an expected renewed Russian offensive, Milley added his voice to warnings. “There’s a significant battle yet ahead down in the south-east, down around the Donbas region where the Russians intend to amass forces and continue their assault,” he told the panel. The US and NATO did not agree to supply fighter jets to Ukraine or other heavy weaponry, and did not step in to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine because of the stated risk that the west could be drawn into a direct war with Russia in that situation. But Milley said the US and its allies have delivered around 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons systems and 60,000 anti-tank systems. This has helped Ukraine prevent Putin’s forces from achieving air superiority, despite Russia’s devastating bombardment of parts of the country. A Ukrainian official is warning residents in the east that they have a “last chance” to flee before a major Russian offensive expected in the Donbas region, AFP writes. These few days may be the last chance to leave” and Russia was “trying to cut off all possible ways of getting people out,” Sergiy Gaiday, governor of the Lugansk region, part of the Donbas, where the city of Severodonetsk is coming under sustained artillery and rocket fire. However, trains evacuating residents are halted by Russian strikes on the only line still under Kyiv’s control, the head of the Ukrainian rail operator, Oleksandr Kamychin, said, describing it as a lifeline for tens of thousands. The enemy carried out strikes on the rail line next to the station in Barbenkovo on the Donetsk line,” he said in a post on the messaging service Telegram. “We’re waiting for the end of the bombardments to clarify the situation. The passengers on these trains have been moved into the station until this is done,” he said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Cyprus to revoke passports issued to Russians through an investment scheme and stop relevant private yachts docking in its marinas. Zelenskiy made the plea during an address to the Cypriot parliament via live video link, the latest in a series of such speeches he has made to foreign legislatures after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. I’m grateful to you for your moral stance. You reacted to the Russian invasion and banned the docking of Russian ships in your ports... ...Stop Russian golden passports, dual citizenship. Except those where there is evidence they do not harm Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. He said that Cyprus has “tools to pressure” its traditionally close friend Russia, and urged Cypriot authorities to “close the ports” to all Russian private yachts. He called on the Cypriots to revoke passports issued to wealthy Russians under the disgraced citizenship-for-investment scheme shut down under corruption allegations in November 2020. After attending the session, Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades told reporters that instructions were given for revocation of four passports of Russians on the European Union’s sanctions list. During the investment scheme, Cyprus issued hundreds of passports to Russian nationals and their families. In November 2020, the Mediterranean island dropped the initiative after Al Jazeera aired a documentary showing reporters posing as fixers for a Chinese businessman seeking a Cypriot passport despite having a criminal record. A public inquiry found that around half of the 6,779 passports issued under the programme were granted illegally. Cyprus, a European Union member, allowed investors to acquire a passport in exchange for an investment of $2.5 million euros (US $3 million). During the 20-minute speech, a short video showed bomb-scarred cities like Mariupol and the bodies of Ukrainian civilians. Cyprus has sent more than 215 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, its largest contribution overseas. It has also received around 10,000 Ukrainian refugees in a country with a relatively large Russian diaspora. A protest against the war took place outside parliament during the session. At least one person was killed and 14 wounded in shelling on Ukraine’s northeastern city of Kharkiv earlier today, the regional governor Oleh Synehubov said in an online video address, Reuters reports. The Ukrainian military earlier said Russian troops were bombarding the city with shells and rockets. Russia denies targeting civilians. We’ll have more on this shortly. But Synehubov has accused the Russians of pounding civilian infrastructure. Earlier, Russia’s defence ministry had said it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the southeast of the country. When this report came out about 11 hours ago, there was no independent verification of the news. Details are sparse. But we’ll bring you more on what Oleh Synehubov has said as soon as we get it. It is just past 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: The Kremlin has admitted suffering “significant losses” of troops since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, in a rare admission of how badly the war has gone. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said he hoped the besieged city of Mariupol would be “liberated from nationalistic battalions” sooner rather than later. A Russian airstrike on a railway near Barvinkove station in Donetsk Oblast has blocked three evacuation trains from leaving, according to reports. Thousands of passengers who were meant to be evacuated on the trains have been placed at the station, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in Borodyanka, a town about 25km west of Bucha. She did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but accused Russian troops of carrying out airstrikes on the town, which is being searched by Ukrainian authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. The Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, says more than 100,000 people still urgently need to be evacuated from the city. Speaking on national television, he described the situation in the Russian-besieged Ukrainian port city as a humanitarian catastrophe. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on the Greek parliament to use its influence to rescue the remaining population in Mariupol, which has had large ethnic Greek populations for centuries. The United Nations general assembly has voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the US-led motion, while 24 countries voted against and 58 countries abstained. Russia will probably renew its attack on Kyiv if it succeeds in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Hruzevych, said. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, earlier today warned that Russian forces were biding their time as Moscow ramped up intelligence operations there and learned how best to fight Ukrainian troops. The mayor of Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, has urged women, children and the elderly to leave because fighting with Russia is expected to intensify in eastern regions. Filatov’s warnings follow similar calls by authorities in the Luhansk region, east of Dnipro. On Wednesday, the regional governor of Luhansk urged all residents to evacuate while they still could in relative safety. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said allies had agreed to strengthen support for Ukraine, and was providing “a wide range” of weapon systems, as well as cybersecurity assistance and equipment to protect against chemical and biological threats. There was no sign Vladimir Putin intended to pull back, he added. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called for more heavy weaponry from western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow, warning: “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late, and many people will die.” G7 foreign ministers condemned “in the strongest terms” the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns. In a joint statement, ministers spoke of “haunting” photographs of mutilated bodies, alleged executions and reports of sexual assaults by Russian troops. German intelligence agencies have intercepted radio messages from Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in Ukraine, according to reports. Two separate communications are said to have been intercepted, in which Russian soldiers describe how they question soldiers as well as civilians, and then proceed to shoot them, the Washington Post cited an intelligence official as saying. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my US colleague, Joanna Walters. Thank you for reading. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in the town of Borodyanka, around 25km west of Bucha, Reuters reports. She did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but accused Russian troops of carrying out airstrikes on the town, which is being searched by Ukrainian authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew. Speaking in a televised briefing, Venediktova said: Borodyanka is the worst in terms of destruction and in terms of the uncertainty about [the number of] victims. On Tuesday, Venediktova said the number of victims in Borodyanka would be higher than anywhere else, but did not provide further details. The Kremlin has admitted suffering “significant losses” of troops since Russia invaded Ukraine, in a rare admission of how badly the war has gone. In an interview with Sky News, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was asked whether the war had amounted to a humiliation for Russia given the number of troops lost. Peskov replied: We have significant losses of troops. And it’s a huge tragedy for us. He did not specific a casualty toll. In late March, Russia said it had lost 1,351 soldiers, with another 3,825 wounded. By contrast, a senior Nato official estimated in late March that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in four weeks of fighting in Ukraine. Peskov said Russia was “sorry” about its suspension from the UN’s human rights council over its invasion of Ukraine, adding: We’ll continue to defend our interests using every possible legal means. He also insisted Russian forces were “never shelling civilian objects” since the beginning of the war, claiming: They were just aiming and using high-precision missiles to attack military infrastructure in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesman also claimed that the horrifying images that have emerged from Bucha over the last week were “fabricated and fake”. When asked if he realised “how grotesque” that sounded, Peskov replied: It’s a bold fake and we’ve been speaking about that for a couple of days but no one would listen to us. The aggressive debunking of “fakes” has become a key component of Russia’s propaganda war in Ukraine. A Russian airstrike on a railway near Barvinkove station in Donetsk Oblast has blocked three evacuation trains from leaving, according to reports. Thousands of passengers who were meant to be evacuated on the trains have been placed at the station, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. It was the only Ukrainian-controlled railway exit from the northern part of Donetsk region, according to reports. From Ukrainian MP, Lesia Vasylenko: Note: the Guardian has not yet been able to verify these reports. Here’s more on the UN general assembly vote to suspend Russia from the UN’s human rights council. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the resolution and 58 countries abstained. Twenty-four member countries voted against the motion, including Belarus, China, Iran, Russia and Syria. Here’s the full list: It is almost 7.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region.

I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, reporting from London, I’ll continue to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, is being interviewed by Sky News, which asked him whether Russia was determined to take the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol “whatever the cost of human life”. Peskov replied: Mariupol is going to liberated from nationalistic battalions. We hope it will happen sooner rather than later. He reiterated Russia’s claim that the maternity ward bombing in Mariupol last month was “fake”. The hospital was a fake hospital. It was a fake and we have very serious reasons to believe that it was a fake. At least four people were reportedly killed and 16 injured in the Russian bombing of the children’s hospital and maternity ward, including a child, prompting outrage from Ukrainians and the world. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he was “grateful” to UN member states who “chose the right side of history” and voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Kuleba said: War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. The United Nations general assembly has voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the US-led motion, while 24 countries voted against and 58 countries abstained. In a draft of the resolution, the 193-member general assembly expressed “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine”, particularly at reports of rights abuses by Russia. In a video address to the Greek parliament, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on the country to use its influence to rescue the remaining population in the devastated city of Mariupol, Reuters reports. Some 100,000 people are still trapped in Mariupol, Zelenskiy told Greek lawmakers, urging: We must save whoever we can. The Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Odesa, which both have had large ethnic Greek populations for centuries, needed “immediate assistance”, he said. Please use your influence as EU members to better organise whatever rescue can be carried out in Mariupol. He also called for stronger bans on Russian banks and tankers, urging the EU to “shut the door” so Russian banks could not make money on the global credit system. Zelenskiy received a standing ovation in parliament at the close of his speech, which was boycotted by the Greek communists and a small nationalist party. Earlier today, Greece’s foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Athens would call on the international criminal court (ICC) to investigate “crimes of war” in Mariupol, telling reporters: Greece has a specific, special interest for Mariupol because of the existence of a 100,000 and more Greek community in Mariupol. The World Health Organization (WHO) is preparing for possible “chemical assaults” in Ukraine, the body’s European head, Hans Kluge, said, Reuters reports. Speaking during a briefing from Lviv, Ukraine, he said: Given the uncertainties of the current situation, there are no assurances that the war will not get worse. WHO is considering all scenarios and making contingencies for different situations that could afflict the people of Ukraine, from the continued treatment of mass casualties, to chemical assaults. Kluge declined to give further details about the WHO’s preparations. Asked about a possible Russian chemical attack on Ukraine, he responded: The short answer is that WHO is preparing for any eventuality within our mandate. Our foreign correspondent Luke Harding interviews a witness to the bombing of Mariupol’s drama theatre who fled by swimming along the shoreline to reach Ukrainian-controlled territory. Dmitry Yurin was at home on 16 March when a Russian bomb struck Mariupol’s drama theatre. His flat in Prospect Mira was a couple of hundred metres away, across a square with a fountain. The theatre had become a capacious air raid shelter. Hundreds of women and children were inside. “It was terrible, a massive blast, an enormous explosion. I heard cries and screams,” Yurin said. I saw bodies and bits of bodies. I pulled one woman out, then a girl, and then a boy. All were hurt. The boy’s legs didn’t move. He was screaming. My hands were shaking. I was covered in blood. Nearby a woman lay motionless on the ground. Family members were desperately attempting to resuscitate her, pressing on her chest. They were trying to bring her back. There was a child standing next to her, saying: ‘Mum, don’t sleep.’ The woman was dead. The exact number of people who perished in the Russian airstrike is still unknown. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says 300 people were killed. Witnesses including Yurin confirm there were dozens of bodies. They say continuous Russian shelling made rescue work dangerous. Yurin said he went back to the garage where he had been sheltering with his mother, Nadezhda, lit a cigarette and swallowed some tablets. He decided he had to get out of Mariupol, which for two gruesome weeks Russian forces had attacked and besieged. The city was cut off from all directions. He came up with an extraordinary plan. Yurin decided he would swim to safety. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, was speaking earlier to reporters after meeting with Nato foreign ministers in Brussels, where he urged weapons to be sent to Kyiv now or “your help will come too late”, AFP reports. Kuleba said: Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks, or your help will come too late, and many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed. Exactly because this help came too late. He said he had “no doubts” that Ukraine would have the weapons necessary to fight. The question is the timeline. This discussion is not about the list of weapons. The discussion is about the timeline. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, is addressing the media after today’s meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. He warned the war could last for years, and said the key to an early solution was down to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said: The easiest way to end this war is for President Putin to pull back all its troops, and to end the war, and to sit down and engage in in serious diplomatic efforts to find the solution. But we need to be realistic, and we have no indications that President Putin has changed his over overall goal, and that is to control Ukraine and to achieve significant military victories on the battleground. What we see is Russian regrouping and repositioning their forces moving out of northern Ukraine, but at the same time moving those forces to the east and we expect a big battle in Donbas. And that’s the reason why allies also highlighted today the urgency of providing more support to Ukraine. That’s the reason why also allies are imposing heavy costs on President Putin and Russia. But at the same time, we are prepared for the long haul. This war may last for weeks, but also months, and possibly also for years. And therefore we need to prepare for a lot more. He also warned that as long as the war continued, there would be a risk of the war escalating, saying: If the war is going to drag on then the risk is first and foremost for the people of Ukraine who will suffer more, we’ll see more damage, more death and more destruction. But of course, as long as the war continues, there will be a risk for escalation beyond the Ukraine. And that’s exactly what Nato is focused on, to prevent that escalation. There are two areas where the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has been saying he is unable to provide more detail. Firstly, this is on the exact nature of weapon supplies to Ukraine. He was keen to paint a picture of continuing support of Ukraine from Nato since 2014. I fully understand that you’re asking specific questions about specific types of weapons. At the same time, I think it’s important to understand that I believe it is better often to not be specific exactly about what kind of systems, but rest assured allies are providing a wide range of different weapons systems. Nato have supported Ukraine for many years since the illegal annexation of Crimea and Russia’s first invasion in 2014 also into Donbas. Nato allies and Nato have provided significant support with equipment with training tens of thousand of soldiers. And then when we saw the intelligence indicating a highly likely invasion we stepped up last autumn. He was then asked a specific question about a video that has emerged which appears to show Ukrainian forces shooting a Russian soldier who has been captured. Stoltenberg said he was unfamiliar with the specific video, but said: I will say that every report on potential violations of international law should be followed or looked into, and of course, any violation of international law and any war crime is always unacceptable. On the global and long-lasting impact of Russia’s aggression, Stoltenberg said: What is happening in Ukraine is being closely watched around the world. We have seen that China is unwilling to condemn Russia’s aggression. And Beijing has joined Moscow in questioning the right of nations to choose their own path. This is a serious challenge. The sanctions introduced by Nato allies and our partners are unprecedented, and they are damaging. He said that Nato’s new strategy would take into account this global shift and “deliver a response on how we relate to Russia in the future”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that some of the package to help “brave Ukrainians” to “defend their homes and the country and push back the invading forces” included “stepping up humanitarian aid and financial support”. He said: We discussed what more we will do, including cybersecurity assistance, and providing the equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical and biological threats. Jens Stoltenberg has announced that Nato will be making moves to provide more support to Georgia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. For Georgia, we could increase our support through the substantial Nato Georgia package, including in areas like situational awareness, secure communications, and cyber. For Bosnia-Herzegovina. We could develop a new defence capacity-building package, and assistance will be tailored, demand-driven, and delivered with the full consent of the countries concerned. He stressed that nations such as Finland, Sweden, Georgia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Australia and Japan, all non-Nato members, were at the meeting because Russia’s actions had a global security impact. Jens Stoltenberg is talking now. The video feed should be available above. The secretary general of Nato has started by saying that the organisation will do more now, and for the medium and longer term to support Ukraine. I will bring you the key quotes and lines. Turkey has been attempting to play a mediating role in events. It hosted a round of face-to-face peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and this morning also hosted a video call with countries that border the Black Sea about the security situation there. Now the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has said that he will be heading to Washington. Reuters reports he told the media after today’s Nato meeting that he had been invited by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to visit for talks on 18 May. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will be giving a press briefing shortly. We will have a live video stream embedded in the blog. You may need to refresh the page and press play in order to see it. Dmytro Kuleba has also told the media that the discussion at Nato was not about the list of weapons Ukraine would get, but rather about the timeline for when they would be given. The Ukrainian foreign minister said that he had no doubt that Ukraine would have the weapons necessary to fight. Reuters reports him reiterating that sanctions inflict damage on Russia, but are not enough alone to stop the war. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has warned at today’s meeting in Brussels that the scale of any impending Russian assault on Donbas will remind the Nato allies of the second world war. “Either you help us now - and I’m speaking about days, not weeks - or your help will come too late, and many people will die,” Reuters reports him telling the media. That statement from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has received a curt reply from the Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak. He dismissed Lavrov’s comments that Kyiv had presented Moscow with a draft peace deal that deviated from proposals both sides had previously agreed on. Podolyak told Reuters in a written statement that Lavrov was not directly involved in negotiations and his statements were “of purely propagandistic significance”. Podolyak said Moscow wanted to divert attention from events in the town of Bucha, where Ukraine accuses Russian troops of killing civilians, and added: “That is how any such statements should be regarded.” It is Martin Belam back here on the blog for now. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia will probably renew its attack on the Ukrainian capital if it succeeds in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Hruzevych, said. Speaking at an online briefing, Hruzevych said: It is likely the enemy has not given up the goal of a second attack on Kyiv – there is such a threat. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, earlier today warned that Russia’s long-term objective is to seize all of Ukraine despite its short-term focus being the east of the country. Russian forces were biding their time as Moscow ramped up intelligence operations there and learned how best to fight Ukrainian troops, she said. Malyar told a video briefing: The key objective of the Russian Federation was and is the capture of the entire territory of Ukraine. Russia planned to do this quickly, but Putin’s blitzkrieg failed. Even so, Russia has not abandoned its plan to take the entire territory of Ukraine. Russia planned to achieve some “smaller objectives” in order to “show results”, she said. But in reality it is using any moment to gather its forces, to regroup its armies, in order to continue its assault. The enemy is learning how to fight us. If in the first days the Russian army was disorientated, then they are now adjusting to our tactics and strategy, and taking time ... in order to learn how to fight our strategy. A Ukrainian negotiator has accused Russian “propagandists” of being “as responsible for atrocities in Ukraine” as Russian troops. Mykhailo Podolyak, a key adviser to President Zelenskiy and a member of Ukraine’s delegation in talks with Russia, said Moscow’s “hostility in media” must be reduced to prove it is ready for dialogue. The mayor of Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, has urged women, children and the elderly to leave because fighting with Russia is expected to intensify in eastern regions, Reuters reports. The mayor, Borys Filatov, said in an online video address: All those who have the ability, as I have already said, should leave. This involves women, children, the elderly, those who are not …. directly integrated into the economy. Dnipro, which usually has a population of almost one million people, has so far been spared the worst of the fighting that has devastated cities further east and south, such as Mariupol. Filatov’s warnings follow similar calls by authorities in the Luhansk region, east of Dnipro. On Wednesday, the regional governor of Luhansk urged all residents to evacuate while they still could in relative safety. Boris Johnson described Russia’s actions in Ukraine as the “systematic slaughter of innocent people” but stopped short of using the word “genocide”, PA Media news agency reports. Johnson said: I think people are looking at what is happening in Ukraine and they can see this is systematic slaughter of innocent people. Whatever term you want to use, it is totally unconscionable, and the world is now overwhelmingly on the side of the Ukrainians. The UK will continue with our friends and partners to do everything we can to help. When asked about reports that the UK would be sending armoured vehicles to the Ukrainian army, he said the government was looking at what further military assistance it could give. Johnson said: We have tougher sanctions coming in today on [Russian state-owned] Sberbank, individuals, and we are certainly looking at what more military assistance we can give. The Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, said his country must be involved in negotiations to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Lukashenko was quoted by the Belarusian state news agency Belta as saying that he expected to hold talks with Vladimir Putin in the next few days. Lukashenko said: There can be no separate agreements behind Belarus’s back. Since you dragged us into this – principally western countries – the position of Belarus naturally needs to be heard at these negotiations. Belarus’s foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, insisted Lukashenko himself “must participate in the (final) meeting”. Lukashenko also claimed Belarus had been unfairly labelled “an accomplice of the aggressor” as a result of western sanctions. Belta quoted Lukashenko as saying: We do not need this war. Because as a result of this conflict between two Slavic peoples, we are the ones who may suffer the most. German intelligence agencies have intercepted radio messages from Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in Ukraine, according to reports. Local news magazine Der Spiegel reported on Thursday that the country’s office had intercepted the radio messages and presented the findings in parliament. Separately, the Washington Post reported Germany’s foreign intelligence service claimed to have intercepted two separate communications, in which Russian soldiers described how they question soldiers as well as civilians, and then proceed to shoot them. The Post cited an intelligence official it said was familiar with the findings. It was not clear in which part of Ukraine the recordings come from. The Kremlin said it was bewildered by the US decision to impose sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s daughters, describing the move as “difficult to understand and explain”, Reuters reports. The US announced fresh sanctions yesterday targeting the Russian leader’s two adult daughters, Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, as well as Russia’s biggest public and private banks. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters today: Of course we consider these sanctions in themselves to be the extension of an absolutely rabid position on the imposition of restrictions. In any case, the ongoing line on imposing restrictions against family members speaks for itself. The Kremlin could not comprehend why Putin’s daughters would be targeted, he claimed. This is something that is difficult to understand and explain. Unfortunately, we have to deal with such opponents. Russian troops used civilians as human shields to try to protect themselves from a counter-attack from Ukrainian forces in a village in northern Ukraine, the BBC reports. Villagers from Obukhovychi, just south of the exclusion zone around the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, said Russian troops were losing soldiers and armoured vehicles to a counter-attack from Ukrainian forces on the night of 14 March. They said Russian troops went door-to-door to round up about 150 people at gunpoint and held them in a freezing cold school gym as protection for Russian forces. Lydmila Sutkova, one of the villagers interviewed by the BBC, told them: They took us from the cellars where we were hiding and forced us out. Old ladies, children, everyone. It was terrifying. They broke open the doors of anyone who wouldn’t open up. Another villager, Maryana, said her daughter was still showing signs of anxiety since the night: A two-year-old girl should not see this. I was afraid that we would all be shot in that gym. I was scared for my daughter. I don’t have the words. When the Russian invasion reached Mariupol in Ukraine at the end of February, Alena Zagreba, 15, went from filming vlogs with her friends to chronicling the destruction of her home city. While most people hid in bunkers and cellars, Alena and her parents stayed above ground, and her videos are a rare insight into the intense attacks by Russian forces. Alena melted snow for water while her parents cooked on makeshift firepits outside. The family survived by moving from house to house as shelling made their home and other shelters uninhabitable. Alena said at one point in the diary that her nerves had been “destroyed” by the constant bombardment. Our Helena Smith watched Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy address the Greek parliament in Athens. Here is her report: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has received rapturous applause addressing the Greek parliament today. The leader went to the heart of the matter by kicking off his speech with mention of Mariupol, the strategically important south-eastern port city that has become a symbol of the suffering Ukraine has suffered at the hands of Russian forces. With over 100,000 ethnic Greeks living there the besieged town has a special place in Greek hearts, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has repeatedly said. “For over a month I have woken up every day thinking of Mariupol,” Zelenskiy told Greek MPs. “What has happened [there] has not happened in European history for more than half a century … Russian soldiers are destroying everything, they have bombed hospitals, maternity wards even the town’s municipal theatre. We have all seen these things, we have all seen what Russian pilots have done. Mariupol has been destroyed. This peaceful town has experienced the violence of Russian troops.” Appealing to Greek sensitivity regarding the presence of a once vibrant diaspora in the Black Sea region, Zelenskiy said there were now fears that the country would lose a large part of its identity “that Greek culture had brought”. “This was the cradle of the Greek community for centuries,” he said before two Ukrainian fighters of Greek heritage also addressed the chamber. Invoking the mantra of battle-hardened Greeks during the war of independence against the Ottoman empire which began in 1821, the Ukrainian leader added: “Your own revolutionaries said ‘freedom or death’ and that today is what we are saying. Beside Mariupol, Odesa, another big centre of Hellenism, is also threatened.” Zelenskiy also referred to the Filiki Etairia, a secret society of friends that was founded in Odesa with the aim of overthrowing Ottoman rule. “The Filiki Etairia was also created here and this is of huge significance,” he told lawmakers. “A Filiki Etairia could [now] be created in Greece [for the purpose of giving] immediate help which Mariupol and Odesa so need … With the practical solidarity of Greece we will be able to emerge victorious.” G7 foreign ministers have condemned “in the strongest terms” the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns. In a joint statement, they said: Haunting images of civilian deaths, victims of torture, and apparent executions, as well as reports of sexual violence and destruction of civilian infrastructure show the true face of Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and its people. The massacres in the town of Bucha and other Ukrainian towns will be inscribed in the list of atrocities and severe violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights, committed by the aggressor on Ukrainian soil. Ministers expressed their “heartfelt solidarity with the Ukrainian people and our deepest condolences to the victims”. We underline our unwavering support for Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders and express our readiness to assist further, including with military equipment and financial means, to allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russia’s aggression and to rebuild Ukraine. Russia should be suspended from the UN human rights council, they added. Ministers “welcome and support” the work to investigate and gather evidence of potential war crimes and crimes against humanity. They urged Russia to “withdraw completely its military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders”. Hello, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. As always, feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster Ukraine’s war effort, including warplanes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato headquarters, where Nato foreign ministers are meeting later today, Kuleba said there were three items on his agenda for when he spoke to the allies and held bilateral meetings: “Weapons, weapons and weapons.” The UN general assembly will vote later today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. Russia’s defence ministry says it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the south-east of the country. Russian air attacks are now focused mainly on areas of eastern Ukraine, and Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the region, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said. There are to be 10 humanitarian corridors open for civilian evacuations across Ukraine today, but Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said residents trying to leave Mariupol would again have to use their own vehicles. The mayor of the besieged city says more than 100,000 people still need urgent evacuation from the city, and that more than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the US supplying Ukraine with weapons “will not contribute to the success of Russian-Ukrainian talks”. Poland’s deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz has said the country needs financial assistance after the arrival of 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees, many of them children, into his country. The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Athens would ask the international court of justice at The Hague to investigate war crimes in the besieged city of Mariupol. Ukraine and Hungary have again exchanged barbed words. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it considered Hungary’s willingness to pay for Russian gas in roubles an “unfriendly act”. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, has confirmed that fuel for Hungary’s nuclear power plants has arrived by air from Russia, and restated that Hungary does not support proposals for European energy sanctions against Russia. Defence ministers from Black Sea coastal countries have held a video call to discuss the war in Ukraine, mines floating in the sea and regional security, the Turkish defence ministry said, adding that the ministers called for an immediate ceasefire. Russia’s communications watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for allegedly violating Russian law. Roskomnadzor accused YouTube of being one of the “key platforms” it claims is spreading fake information about Russia’s conduct in the war. YouTube has suspended the account of Chinese national Wang Jixian in Odesa who has criticised Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, after being reported to the platform for content containing “suspected violence”. The number of alleged Russian war crimes Ukraine says is currently under investigation has increased to 4,820 according to a recent update from Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said her country was imposing sanctions on 67 Russians over the invasion of Ukraine. Austria, meanwhile, is to expel four Russian diplomats. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. I am handing over to Léonie Chao-Fong Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday called on the west to “bring Russia to justice”, saying Moscow’s actions were directed not only against Ukraine but also Europe. “Once and for all, we can teach Russia and any other potential aggressors that those who choose war always lose ... those who blackmail Europe with economic and energy crisis always lose,” Zelenskiy said in an address to Greek lawmakers in Athens, speaking through an interpreter. Reuters reports that he reiterated calls that the democratic world reject Russian oil and completely block Russian banks from the international finance system. “Let us be honest, since the very beginning Russia’s actions were directed not only against Ukraine but also Europe,” he said. He accused Russia of doing all it could economically to provoke inflation across the continent. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us over the newswires from Hostomel and Borodyanka in Ukraine. The mayor of Mariupol says over 100,000 people still need urgent evacuation from the city, Reuters reports. There are set to be ten humanitarian corridors open for civilian evacuations across Ukraine today, but earlier Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said residents trying to leave Mariupol will again have to use their own vehicles. “Pumping weapons into Ukraine will not contribute to the success of Russian-Ukrainian talks,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters when asked about US weapons supplies to Ukraine. “Of course this will most likely have a negative effect.” Reuters also reports these key lines from Peskov’s regular briefing: Peskov said sanctions being applied by the US on Putin’s family speak for themselves, and that it is hard to understand or explain the move He said Putin has yet to decide whether to attend the next G20 summit – which is due in Indonesia in November – and a decision will be taken according to how events unfold. Also on the energy side of things, Finland has said it will invest up to €850m (£700m) to ensure sufficient energy supply and to speed up breaking away from its dependence on Russian energy. Reuters reports the country will also acquire a new floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal together with Estonia to be placed in Finland to put an end to gas deliveries from Russia, minister of economic affairs Mika Lintila said The oil company Shell has confirmed it will take a hit of between $4bn and $5bn (£3.1bn and £3.8bn) from offloading its Russian assets as the firm pulls back from the country. Bosses said they will no longer buy oil on the spot market but will continue to fulfil contracts on buying fuel from Russia signed before the invasion of Ukraine. PA Media quotes the company saying: “Shell has not renewed longer-term contracts for Russian oil, and will only do so under explicit government direction, but we are legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion.” The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, says Athens will ask the international court of justice at The Hague to investigate war crimes in the besieged city of Mariupol. “Greece will request that the international court of justice investigate war crimes that have occurred in Mariupol,” he said in comments made before attending today’s meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. “Greece has a particular interest in Mariupol because of the Greek community of more than 100,000 people there. In addition I will ask my counterparts in the alliance to do the best that they can to [not only] help Ukraine but to protect Odesa, so that Odesa does not suffer the same fate as Mariupol.” Dendias, who led a humanitarian aid mission to the southern port city at the weekend, made the comments before Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addresses Athens’ 300-seat parliament today. During his trip to Odesa on Sunday, the Greek foreign minister also announced the reopening of Greece’s consulate there to help ethnic Greeks flee areas in the south-east that are now the focus of Russia’s military offensive. “The reopening of [Greece’s] consulate will help distribute humanitarian aid and set up corridors for the Greek ethnic community to leave from any areas of Ukraine, if needed, via Odesa,” he said. Russian air attacks are now focused mainly on areas of eastern Ukraine, and Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the region, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said. He said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain. “The situation is under control,” he said on national television, Reuters reports. Russia’s communications watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for allegedly violating Russian law. Reuters reports that the Roskomnadzor watchdog accused YouTube, which has blocked Russian state-funded media globally from using its platform, of becoming “one of the key platforms spreading fakes about the course of special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation”. Russia has continued to officially describe its attack on Ukraine as a “special military operation”, and has made varying claims that images of atrocities that have emerged from Bucha and elsewhere in the country are a staged “provocation”. Ukraine’s foreign minister has called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster the country’s war effort, including war planes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato’s headquarters, where foreign ministers are due to meet today, Dmytro Kuleba said there were three items on his agenda: “Weapons, weapons and weapons”. Here is the video clip: The UK’s Ministry of Defence have issued their latest assessment of the situation in the ground in Ukraine. They say: Progressing offensive operations in eastern Ukraine is the main focus of Russian military forces. Russian artillery and air strikes continue along the Donbas line of control. Russian strikes against infrastructure targets within the Ukrainian interior are likely intended to degrade the ability of the Ukrainian military to resupply and increase pressure on the Ukrainian government. Despite refocussing forces and logistics capabilities to support operations in the Donbas, Russian forces are likely to continue facing morale issues and shortages of supplies and personnel. Earlier the Russian defence ministry says it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv, which are all towards the east of Ukraine and the Donbas area. [see 8.32am] Poland’s deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz has been on the media in the UK this morning, telling the BBC Today programme that the country needs financial assistance over the volume of Ukrainian refugees now in Poland. PA Media quotes him saying: They could offer a bit more financial support, you know, those 2.5 million people need accommodation. Half of them basically are kids, which we are successfully integrating to the Polish schooling system. But it also brings some costs. Suddenly, in a couple of weeks, we are 2.5 million bigger. So any kind of financial assistance would be very much welcome. Przydacz also said that he opposed countries having quotas on accepting refugees: These are our neighbours. Ukrainian friends are very much welcome to stay in Poland. People are free people. If they want to go to the Great Britain and the Great Britain is ready to host them - we have absolutely nothing against them. But we are strongly opposing the policy of quotas or forcing people to live in a country. Tension between Ukraine and Hungary has not eased this morning, with Reuters carrying quotes from two simultaneous briefings. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has this morning said that it considers Hungary’s willingness to pay for Russian gas in roubles an “unfriendly act”. Ukraine also said that Hungary’s stance over the allegations of Russian atrocities strengthens Russia’s sense of impunity and encourages Russia “to commit new atrocities against Ukrainians.” Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said “If Hungary really wants to help end the war, here’s how to do it: stop destroying unity in the EU, support new anti-Russian sanctions, provide military assistance to Ukraine, and not create additional sources of funding for Russia’s military machine. It is never too late to get on the right side of history,” For their part, Hungary’s foreign minister Péter Szijjártó has confirmed that fuel for Hungary’s nuclear power plants has arrived by air from Russia. The Russian attack on Ukraine has made shipments by rail impossible. He has restated that Hungary does not support proposals for European energy sanctions against Russia. He added that imposing any sanctions on activities related to nuclear energy would also be a “red line” for Hungary. There has been an increasing tension between Hungary and Ukraine in the last few days. Viktor Orbán described Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as one of the enemies he “over-powered” with his election victory at the weekend. For his part, Zelenskiy said Orbán was frightened of Moscow and needed to choose between Russia and the “other world”. The two countries share about 135 km (85 miles) of border, roughly following the Tisza river to the west of Ukraine. Defence ministers from Black Sea coastal countries have held a video call to discuss the war in Ukraine, mines floating in the sea and regional security, the Turkish Defence Ministry said, adding the ministers called for an immediate ceasefire. Reuters reports from Ankara that in a statement, Turkey said the defence ministers of Bulgaria, Georgia, Poland, Romania and Ukraine had met via video conference upon the invitation of Turkey, adding they held “very efficient” talks. “Aside from the mines, the importance of cooperation in the Black Sea for peace, calm and stability was emphasised,” Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar, who participated in the call, said after the meeting. According to his ministry, the ministers discussed possible steps to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and get aid to Ukraine. Turkish military diving teams have so far detonated three separate floating naval mines in the Black Sea, while Romania has also defused a stray mine in its waters since the Ukraine war. A quick Reuters snap here that Russia’s defence ministry says it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the southeast of the country. There is as yet no independent verification of this claim. Yesterday the Ukrainian State Emergency Service released images of firefighters working to extinguish flames at a fuel storage depot that had been struck in the Dnipropetrovsk region. A quick quote from UK foreign secretary Liz Truss in Brussels here, after she briefly spoke to the media ahead of today’s round of meetings. She said in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine: “the G7 and Nato is stepping up our efforts on sanctions and on weapons. The UK is now banning all imports of Russian energy. We’re sanctioning more banks, and we’re stepping up our supply of weapons to Ukraine.” Mark Voyger is an expert on eastern Europe and Russia – he is a non-resident senior fellow with the Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Center for European Analysis – and he has been interviewed on Sky News in the UK, and made two particularly interesting points. Speaking from Warsaw, on the issue of the Black Sea, he was in favour of Nato patrolling it to deter Russian military activity. He said: The Black Sea is now being turned into a Russian lake just like the Azov Sea was, and the Black Sea actually is shared by multiple Nato members: Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey. So I would say ultimately we need to do that. If there is no no-fly zone, if we feel reluctant to impose it, we can do something about a no-sail zone, if you will, in the Black Sea, because Russia has been targeting international navigation. He was asked who was winning the war, and he had this to say: Ukraine is winning it on the ground, tactically, operationally, internationally, strategically. I will say information-wise, the information warfare is definitely critical. Unfortunately, you know, Putin is still in power and he’s winning the war at home. He is slowly but surely recreating the Soviet system – a totalitarian system that bans all dissent and stifles access to free information. So internationally, Ukraine is winning. Domestically, Russia is winning, until such time that we’re able to penetrate through this thick wall of lies and propaganda and convince the Russian people that he’s bad even for Russian. Foreign minister Marise Payne said this that Australia was imposing sanctions on 67 Russians over the invasion of Ukraine. “Today, I’m announcing 67 further sanctions of Russian elites and oligarchs, those close to Putin who facilitate and support his outrageous actions,” Reuters reports she told reporters as she arrived at Nato. Australia is not a member of Nato, but like Japan, is present at today’s meeting as a guest. Austria is the latest European country to announce diplomatic sanctions against Russia. This morning the foreign ministry there has announced that it is expelling three Russian diplomat from the embassy in Vienna, and one from the consulate in Salzburg. Reuters reports that a foreign ministry spokesperson said the Russian officials had behaved in a way that was incompatible with their diplomatic status. They must leave the country by 12 April. There has been a wave of expulsions of Russian diplomatic staff – although some countries, notably Britain, Canada and Australia, have yet to take any action. Here’s the video clip of Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying that Russia will regard weak sanctions as “permission to attack”. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has posted some pictures of him in his Nato meetings in Brussels, and has repeated his “three things” line: Met with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at Nato HQ in Brussels. I came here today to discuss three most important things: weapons, weapons, and weapons. Ukraine’s urgent needs, the sustainability of supplies, and long-term solutions which will help Ukraine to prevail. Yesterday EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the EU has given €35bn to Russia in energy payments since the start of the war, compared to €1bn given to Ukraine in arms and weapons. There’s no sign of that changing any time soon. Russian state-owned gas producer Gazprom said today it continued to supply natural gas to Europe via Ukraine on Thursday in line with requests from European consumers. Requests stood at 105.4 million cubic metres for 7 April, slightly down on the day before. Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, has announced that Ukraine is aiming to open ten humanitarian corridors on Thursday. Residents trying to leave the besieged city of Mariupol will again have to use their own vehicles. Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs has just published some images of people being evacuated within the country. They say: The State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Donetsk region evacuated 198 people on April 6, 45 of them children. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has just tweeted out a response to developments in the US. He said: Grateful to the US Senate for passing the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act. Important first step towards a lend-lease program to expedite the delivery of military equipment to Ukraine. Looking forward to its swift passage in the House and signing by the US President. This is Martin Belam here in London taking over the blog from Samantha Lock. You can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The number of alleged Russian war crimes Ukraine says is currently under investigation has increased to 4,820 according to a recent update from Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office. It is also believed that 167 children have been killed in Ukraine as result of Russia’s invasion. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster Ukraine’s war effort, including war planes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato headquarters, where Nato foreign ministers are meeting later today, Kuleba said there are three items on his agenda when he talks to the allies and holds bilateral meetings: “Weapons, weapons and weapons”. The Ukrainian foreign minister said there is no distinction between offensive and defensive weapons - any weapons, including tanks and fast jets, would be used to defend Ukraine. He added that any country making this distinction are being hypocritical. The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.” Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr. Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine. He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state. And he’s really only taken control of a small number of population centres. And even they weren’t the ones that he was really going after. So, you know, Mariupol is still not taken. He’s moved his forces out of Kyiv. He’s moved his forces out of Cherniniv. They haven’t taken Kharkiv. They haven’t taken Mykolayiv in the south. So, I think the proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing every day. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting for their country. And they have denied Mr. Putin so many of his strategic objectives. So absolutely, they can win.” Russia is focusing on an impending offensive operation in eastern Ukraine with the aim to take control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukraine’s ministry of defence has said, corroborating western intelligence report. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said some withdrawn Russian units are now located in “tent camps” in a number of regions bordering Ukraine. “The Russian servicemen refuse to take part in further hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. The moral and psychological condition of these personnel is low and tends to deteriorate,” an operational report published this morning reads. Russia “continues to look for ways to solve the problem of replenishing its units with human resources” and has “stepped up work with conscripts who have been discharged from military service since 2012” officials added. The Russian occupiers continue to use violence against civilians in the temporarily occupied territories and are forcible deporting residents of Mariupol to the temporarily occupied districts of Donetsk, the report claimed. More than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the city’s mayor has said. Vadym Boichenko noted that Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death. Boichenko also said that more than 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed due to Russian bombardments. The Russian military has besieged the port city, cutting off access to food, water and energy supplies while continually dropping artillery and air raids on the town. On Wednesday, about 1,000 people were able to make it out of the besieged port city in a convoy of buses and private cars organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They are now at the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia. The ICRC team had tried for five days and four nights to reach Mariupol, coming within 12 miles of the city, but security conditions made it impossible to enter. Ukrainian officials said the Russian military had pounded the city over the past 24 hours, with 118 airstrikes. They also said Russian soldiers were gathering bodies in order to destroy evidence of war crimes. A mobile crematorium was going from street to street, collecting and disposing of corpses from people killed by shelling and shooting. In its latest assessment, the UK’s ministry of defence said the humanitarian situation in Mariupol was deteriorating. “More than 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender,” it said. Russia is blocking humanitarian access to the besieged port city of Mariupol because it wants to hide evidence of “thousands” of people killed there, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. In an interview with Turkey’s Haberturk TV, he said: I think Russia is afraid that [if] we successfully send humanitarian aid to Mariupol, then the whole world will see what’s going on here. Russia doesn’t want anything to be seen until they take control of the city until they clean it all up. Mariupol is hell right now. Thousands have either been killed or injured. The number of those killed and injured is increasing day by day ... we do not have clear information on the number of those who lost their lives. They are trying to cover up the situation. In this case, they are trying to prevent the humanitarian supply. They will not be able to cover up everything. They will not be able to bury or hide thousands of people. The world has seen the real situation. It has seen what has been done to a Ukrainian city.” Zelenskiy said that Russia had already attempted to conceal evidence of crimes in the town of Bucha outside of Kyiv and several nearby communities, where Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of carrying out widespread killings of civilians. “They burned families. Families. Yesterday we found again a new family: father, mother, two children. Little, little children, two. One was a little hand, you know,” Zelensky said. “That’s why I said ‘they are Nazis’.” Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, urged civilians to leave the east of the country “while the opportunity still exists” before a massive Russian military assault that it expects in the coming days. Vereshchuk said authorities would “not be able to help” residents who stayed behind once large-scale fighting erupted. She said the governors of the Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions were calling on people to move immediately to safer areas. “It has to be done now, because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it,” she posted on Telegram. The Kremlin has said it intends to seize the entire Donetsk region, amid reports that Putin is keen to declare victory in Ukraine in time for 9 May, the annual commemoration of the Soviet defeat of Hitler in the second world war. In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that the Russian military continued to build up its forces in preparation for a new offensive in the east, where the Kremlin has said its goal is to “liberate” the Donbas. YouTube has suspended the account of a Chinese national in Odessa who has criticised Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine after being reported to the platform for content containing “suspected violence”, the Guardian’s Rhoda Kwan reports from Taipei. Wang Jixian, whose daily Mandarin vlogs detailing his life in the Ukrainian city made him an internet sensation, was temporarily suspended on Thursday last week. In his video immediately before the suspension, his video showed Chinese translations of a voice recording of Ukrainians speaking about atrocities committed by Russian soldiers. The Beijing native began posting daily vlogs on his YouTube channel shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. “Today is … I am still in Odesa. I am still alive,” his videos begin. His daily updates quickly drew more than 100,000 followers but also the ire of China’s legions of nationalistic netizens. His channel suddenly went quiet last week. Read the full story below. Zelenskiy described Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously. Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros to Russia from the oil trade, so as not to jeopardise their own economies... The embargo on Russian oil supplies will be applied anyway. The format will be found. The only question is how many more Ukrainian men and women the Russian military will have time to kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, can borrow a little determination somewhere.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine will also continue to insist on a complete blockade of the Russian banking system from international finance. Here are some of the latest images to come from Ukraine today. In Bucha, two young girls walks hand-in-hand past destroyed Russian military machinery littering the main town street. A child’s teddy bear hangs from a tree in front of a building bombed by the Russian army in Borodyanka while a damaged playground is seen next to a heavily damaged apartment building in Hostomel. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. New investments in Russia are blocked, restrictions are applied against several systemic banks in Russia, personal sanctions are added, as well as other restrictions. This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough.” In his signature nightly national address the Ukrainian president added: If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons we really need and have applied for many times, it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to go further. A permission to attack. A permission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas.” However, Zelenskiy remained optimistic saying “it is still possible to prevent this”. It is still possible to impose such sanctions, which Ukraine insists on, our people insist on. It is still possible to give us weapons that will really stop this aggression. The west can do it. Just as it could have applied preventive sanctions last year to prevent this invasion. If the mistake is made again, if there is no preventive action again, it will be a historic mistake for the whole western world.” Nato foreign ministers will meet in Brussels today to address Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”, the alliance said. Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine. We now see a significant movement of troops away from Kyiv, to regroup, re-arm and resupply, and they shift their focus to the east,” Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said ahead of the meeting. Targeting and murdering civilians is a war crime. All the facts must be established and all those responsible for these atrocities must be brought to justice,” Stoltenberg added, commenting on the horrific images of murdered civilians in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities. Ministers will arrive for talks from 3:30pm local time (2:30pm GMT) and will be joined by their counterparts from Ukraine, Finland, Sweden, Georgia, and the European Union, and by Nato’s Asia-Pacific partners - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. “At a time when authoritarian powers are pushing back on the rules-based international order, it is even more important for democracies to stand together, and protect our values,” Stoltenberg said in a statement published by Nato. Allies are stepping up their support for Ukraine’s right to defend itself, including with anti-tank weapons, air-defence systems and other equipment, as well as increased humanitarian assistance and financial aid.” Allied foreign ministers will also discuss the development of Nato’s next strategic concept, to guide the Alliance’s adaptation to the new global security reality. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. In his daily address on Thursday, he called for the democratic world to reject Russian oil and completely block Russian banks from the international finance system. Zelenskiy said the west’s hesitation to agree on an oil embargo is costing Ukrainian lives. Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously, he added. The US, UK and EU unveiled new sanctions against Moscow. US sanctions target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia as well as sanctions on Putin’s adult daughters. The UK will impose an asset freeze on Russia’s largest bank, place sanctions on eight more oligarchs and end imports of oil and coal by next year, foreign secretary Liz Truss said. The EU announced a wide-ranging package of sanctions, including import bans on coal and transaction bans on banks. Nato’s foreign ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday for two days of talks on bringing an end to the war. The UN General Assembly will vote today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Hungary’s right-wing, Putin-allied prime minister Viktor Orbán gave a press conference in which he said he had offered to broker talks with Russia. He offered to work towards a ceasefire, while stopping short of agreeing to extend EU sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas shipments. Zelenskiy said Kremlin forces were trying to cover up evidence of atrocities. “We have information that the Russian military has changed its tactics and is trying to remove people who have been killed from streets and basements ... this is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more,” he said Thursday, but did not provide evidence. US prosecutors are working with their European and Ukrainian counterparts to help collect evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Russia’s military has now shifted its focus to the east of the Ukraine, with Ukraine authorities in Luhansk and Donetsk warning that civilians should leave “while the opportunity still exists” before a massive Russian military assault that it expects in the coming days. It comes as western officials say Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could go to Donbas and perhaps longer. Russia is hiding ‘thousands’ killed in Mariupol, Zelenskiy said. Russian forces are blocking humanitarian access to the besieged port city of Mariupol because it wants to hide evidence of “thousands” of people killed there, the president said. More than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since the start of Russia’s invasion, the mayor of the besieged city said. Vadym Boichenko said 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed and Russian forces have targeted a hospital where 50 people were burned to death. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to access the city, about 1,000 people made it out of Mariupol in a convoy of buses and private cars organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They are now at the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia. A total of 4,892 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities on Wednesday using humanitarian corridors, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, compared with 3,846 who were evacuated on Tuesday. Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the US to operate deadly Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Defence department spokesman John Kirby said it was a “very small” number of Ukrainian troops who were already in the US before Russia invaded their country. Britain is drawing up plans to send armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to The Times. Options include sending a protected patrol vehicle, such as the Mastiff, or a vehicle like the Jackal, which can be used as a reconnaissance or long-range patrol vehicle, a ministry of defence report said. Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a “good understanding” of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, US deputy secretary of state said. The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.”"

"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",2022-04-07T20:00:02Z,Nino Bucci,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y6yty,"Northern Territory police officer Zachary Rolfe spoke repeatedly about how he could take a paid holiday if he shot someone while on duty, his former fiancee told detectives, according to a transcript of a police interview and a statement released by the NT supreme court. In the wide-ranging interview the woman also said Rolfe told her at different times that he was the first to get his gun out on jobs, and did not turn on his body-worn camera as he did not want people at the police station to see what he was doing. In response to questions from the Guardian, Rolfe has strongly denied making any of the comments, and questioned why his former fiancee, who was also a police officer, did not mention them to her superiors or colleagues at the time. The NT supreme court has released a transcript of the woman’s interview and statement following Rolfe’s acquittal in March on charges of murder and two alternative charges regarding the death of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi Walker. Walker had been shot three times by Rolfe during an arrest in the remote community of Yuendumu, 300km north-west of Alice Springs, in November 2019. Rolfe argued at trial that he shot Walker in defence of himself and a colleague after Walker stabbed him with scissors and struggled with another officer. Guardian Australia does not suggest that the matters raised in the interview and the statement had any bearing on Rolfe’s actions in respect of the death of Kumanjayi Walker or his acquittal by a jury in the subsequent criminal trial. However, as remarks alleged to have been made by a serving police officer, and included in documents put before the court, the Guardian considers there is a public interest in reporting the claims. The woman, who Guardian Australia has chosen not to name, said she started her relationship with Rolfe in early 2018 when the pair both worked at Alice Springs police station. They became engaged within weeks, before Rolfe broke up with her later that year. She said she left the force soon after the separation, and had not spoken to Rolfe for almost a year before the shooting. In August 2020, Det Sen Sgt Kirk Pennuto and Det Sgt Wayne Newell, the officers investigating Walker’s death, interviewed the 26-year-old woman for almost two-and-a-half hours. A year later, in September 2021, the woman made a further brief statement clarifying information she had previously provided. The 92-page transcript of the August interview, along with the later statement, was included in a bundle of material tendered by the prosecution in a pre-trial application to determine what was admissible in Rolfe’s trial. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In that application, the prosecution relied on limited sections of the transcript and statement, largely concerning what Rolfe had allegedly said regarding a previous arrest. The remainder of the transcript, including the alleged statements in this story, was not raised and was not the subject of submissions. Rolfe’s defence team successfully argued none of the material was admissible as evidence, in part because no findings of wrongdoing had been made against Rolfe. Justice John Burns ultimately found that including the material would not help a jury determine whether Rolfe was guilty of the murder of Walker. “Nothing in the evidence of the tendency incidents could … assist the jury in understanding or inferring the accused’s state of mind of the charged events,” Justice Burns said in a January 2022 decision. As a result, evidence about the matters in the transcript was not presented at trial and Rolfe did not have an opportunity to answer it. The interview contains details about how Rolfe’s former fiancee viewed his relationships with policing, the army, and his colleagues. While much of it details her impressions and opinions, it also includes her account of several statements she alleges Rolfe made to her. “Zach said on several occasions to me … that he would like to shoot someone so then he can go on a paid holiday,” she said in the interview. In her later statement, she said Rolfe said words to the effect of “if I shot someone I could go on a six-month holiday”. She said in the police interview: “Because obviously when you shoot someone you go under investigation, like what is happening now, and you go on a paid holiday. “I don’t think he really understood the ramifications of if that ever actually did happen or would happen. And then it did happen. And I couldn’t imagine he’s in a good position now.” Asked later in the interview whether she took Rolfe to be serious she said: “Mm yeah. Because he said it so many times. I think he really did – I think everything is said in like, said in jest is like, oh, it would be a paid holiday, but then when it really happens, is it really a fun paid holiday, like is it really not that serious?” Asked again whether the comments were made flippantly she said “I think some were considered and some were flippant. ’Cause you have to consider something to say something on several occasions.” She said she believed Rolfe had made similar comments on “maybe” five occasions, and that she had responded that it would not be a “fun holiday at all”. In her later statement, she said this occurred when they were talking about going on a holiday and Rolfe would say it off the cuff. It happened several times during conversations at the home they shared in Alice Springs, she said. In a statement to the Guardian, Rolfe strongly denied making any of the alleged comments in this story. He did not respond to individual questions, but raised the fact his ex-fiancee had not reported those comments at the time. “I strongly deny making any of these alleged comments. During our relationship, despite the seriousness of her allegations, she never mentioned them to her superiors or fellow police officers. “Despite me being such an apparently bad guy, [she] stayed with me until I broke off the relationship with her in 2018 and was devastated when I did so.” When asked by Pennuto during her interview why she had not “done anything” with the comments she said Rolfe made to her about a paid holiday, the former fiancee responded: “I don’t know … I loved him at the time and I just – I would say to him, ‘you don’t want to go on that kind of holiday, it’s not a holiday, it’s serious,’ and then he would just like kind of laugh it off. “So I think I, in myself, tried to tell myself that it was – it wasn’t real, like he didn’t actually mean that sort of thing. But there’s no other reason, like I can’t think of why I didn’t tell anyone.” Rolfe and the woman met in late 2017 and were engaged in March 2018, she told police. They separated about six months later. She said they had been planning a wedding before he broke up with her. Pennuto and Newell asked the woman extensive questions about Rolfe’s conduct as a police officer. The woman also told police during her interview that Rolfe had said to her – she believed when he was teaching her to shoot at a range – that he would always be the first person to get his gun out if required on a job. She said in her later signed statement that Rolfe had said to her at the home they shared “I always get my gun out first”, and that he had thought it was funny in the context he was saying it. He also told her, she said, that he did not turn on his body-worn camera, because he did not want people at the station to see what he had been doing. Rolfe’s camera was on during the shooting of Walker, and throughout his time in Yuendumu, with portions of the footage played during his trial. Rolfe’s former fiancee also told police that the “awful” and “terrible” culture at Alice Springs police station generally of “bitching” behind people’s backs was so bad that she ended up leaving the force. In December last year, the prosecution in Rolfe’s murder case made an unsuccessful application to include material relating to his alleged history in policing, known as tendency evidence, in his trial. The prosecution sought to include evidence regarding four incidents in which they alleged Rolfe may have improperly used force while he was involved in an arrest. But his lawyers argued in a pre-trial hearing that on all four occasions Rolfe had been cleared of using inappropriate force, and there had not been any finding of wrongdoing against him during his career. Justice Burns said during the hearing that the prosecution appeared to have “cherrypicked” four arrests from potentially hundreds of others in which Rolfe had been involved without incident. Most of the former fiancee’s interview and statement was not referred to in this application, but her claims relating to the arrest of a man called Malcolm Ryder were referred to by the prosecution as something they would seek to rely on to establish what they alleged was a pattern of behaviour by Rolfe. She said in her interview that Rolfe told her he had asked a colleague at Alice Springs police station to scratch his face after he arrested Ryder in 2018. She said Rolfe wanted to make it appear that Ryder had scratched him during the arrest to justify his use of force. She and Rolfe were not dating at the time of the Ryder incident and she said in her statement that Rolfe told her this later. Ryder was cleared of charges of assaulting police. The fiancee’s claims did not form part of that trial. Rolfe’s lawyer, Luke Officer, said in a statement to the Guardian that it was important to note that so little of the former fiancee’s interview was used in the prosecution’s application. He said the portions referred to in this article were not raised in the application and the transcript and allegations in it were not raised at trial. “If you chose to publish certain extracts of the transcript that were not relied upon by the prosecution and rejected by the trial judge in a failed application to introduce tendency evidence then in our view that is not fair, accurate and balanced.” The transcript of the interview and other materials were released to the media just over two weeks ago after the Guardian and other outlets successfully argued for the lifting of about 20 suppression orders on the case. The woman also gave a second interview to police, but the transcript of this interview was not included in the prosecution’s evidence. During the court hearing determining whether the orders should be lifted, David Edwardson, QC for Rolfe, argued that the tendency evidence was “misconceived” and that suppression orders regarding it should therefore remain in place. He said the tendency material was “no more than an argument that was advanced by the prosecution, unsuccessfully, as to conduct imputed against Mr Rolfe”. “It was inadmissible. It’s unsubstantiated. And there is no public interest, in my submission, in it being put out into the ether, so to speak. “So that’s the basis upon which we maintain our objection.” But Justice Burns said the public interest in open justice and scrutiny of the court’s decisions outweighed any potential damage to Rolfe’s reputation. “Whichever way one looks at the matter, while there may be some embarrassment and potentially some damage to the reputation of Mr Rolfe if the material which is the subject of the suppression orders is published, that is of lesser importance … than ensuring that the public has the means of scrutinising the decisions which have been made by this court and of understanding the decisions that the court has made,” he said. “In my view, it is in the public interest that the decisions made by the court surrounding the evidence which the Crown sought to lead at trial and which was rejected be subject to open scrutiny. “This is particularly so in a case where there are post-trial claims made of interference in the charging process.” Michael Riches, the NT independent commissioner against corruption, announced on 29 March that he was investigating “allegations of improper conduct relating to the arrest and charge” of Rolfe in relation to Walker’s death. The NT police have said they will fully cooperate with the investigation."
"Union rejects pay rise of £1,500 for BT staff and plans strike ballot",2022-04-07T12:17:55Z,Mark Sweney and Sarah Butler,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zeg,"BT has given 58,000 workers a £1,500 pay rise that it says is its biggest award in two decades, despite its largest union rejecting the deal and saying it intends to ballot members over strike action. Last week BT had a £1,200 pay rise offer rejected by the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents about 40,000 of the company’s 100,000 employees, with union bosses describing it as “insulting” and a “relative pay cut” as soaring inflation fuels a cost of living crisis. The CWU has been pushing for a 10% rise at BT in the face of rampant inflation, currently at 6.2%, which the Bank of England forecast could peak at 10% by the end of the year. On Thursday, the union rejected the improved award and said that it would now immediately prepare for a statutory industrial action ballot. BT said the flat-rate pay rise – mostly benefiting its lowest-paid staff – worked out as a rise of between 3% and 8%. It has been backdated to 1 April to coincide with households being hit by multiple price increases, from council tax and VAT on hospitality to broadband and phone bills, and will cost BT about £90m. “While we have continued to extend and strengthen our networks to support the country’s recovery, the pandemic has hit our financial performance, like that of most companies,” said Philip Jansen, the chief executive of BT. “We know that the cost of living continues to rise and by making this award we’re ensuring that our lower-paid workers will benefit most and as soon as possible.” Companies across the UK are holding talks over pay amid rising inflation. On Thursday the supermarket Tesco announced the second pay rise for shop and warehouse workers in a year. On Friday, Sainsbury’s is expected to raise pay for workers in its supermarkets and Argos stores in outer London by 55p an hour so that they will receive the London living wage of £11.05. The improvement makes Sainsbury’s the first supermarket group to pay all its workers above the independently verified living wage after pressure from investors. Sainsbury’s staff in inner London already receive £11.05 an hour after a pay rise last month while those outside the capital receive at least £10 an hour, slightly above the living wage target. The staff receiving the pay rise at BT are mainly those who work at its retail stores, engineers who work at its Openreach subsidiary, and call centre employees, all of whom are based in the UK. BT said talks with Prospect, the union that represents manager-level staff among the 42,000 who have not received a pay award, would commence soon. About 83,000 of BT’s total 100,000 workforce are based in the UK. Last year BT awarded 59,000 frontline workers a special bonus of £1,500 in recognition of their work during the coronavirus pandemic. This comprised a £1,000 cash bonus and £500 in shares, which will be awarded after three years as part of the employee share scheme. The bonus award cost BT about £110m, and the company said the payments represented about 5% of the average employee’s salary. Tesco said on Thursday it was investing £200m to raise its minimum hourly rate of pay by 5.8% to £10.10 from 24 July 2022, the biggest single-year investment in hourly pay for shop and warehouse workers at the UK’s largest supermarket chain in at least a decade. Under the deal agreed with the Usdaw union, some shopping delivery drivers, who currently receive £9.55 an hour, will receive an extra 90p an hour from 1 May, taking their hourly rate to £11.00 from 24 July 2022. The latest pay rise at Tesco comes only seven months after it increased wages for its lowest-paid workers by 2.7% to £9.55 an hour. The new deal has been agreed after Tesco became the lowest-paying supermarket in the UK, with Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl all offering £10 an hour or more, while Asda began paying £9.66 an hour from this month. Businesses are being forced to push through significant pay increases as workers struggle with heavy inflation on the cost of living, and there is heavy competition for suitable staff."
Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed as first Black woman on US supreme court – live,2022-04-07T13:20:24Z,Richard Luscombe,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zny,"One other issue to emerge from this afternoon’s White House press briefing: the Biden administration dismissed as “a publicity stunt” a declaration by the Texas governor Greg Abbott that he was going to bus undocumented migrants to Washington DC. Abbott floated the plan as his response to the upcoming termination of Title 42, a Trump-era immigration policy blocking migrants at the US southern border because of Covid-19. Critics of the administration, and the homeland security department, predict a surge of migrants when the program ends next month. “I’m not aware of any authority the governor would be doing that under,” Psaki said. “I think it’s pretty clear this is a publicity stunt, his own office admits that a migrant would need to voluntarily be transported and he can’t compel them to because enforcement of our country’s immigration government lies with the federal government, not a state.” Inevitably, questions in the White House briefing room turned to Covid-19 and the announcement earlier today that the House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was twice in Joe Biden’s close company without a mask in recent days, had tested positive. Psaki said the administration was not concerned for the 79-year-old president’s age because, under centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) guidelines, the two are not considered “close contacts.” “It’s not arbitrary. It’s not something made up by the White House,” Psaki said of the guidelines. “They define it as being within six feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutes over a 24 hour period that they were not. “In terms of additional testing or anything along those lines, those assessments would be made by the president’s doctor. He was tested last evening and tested negative. “We have incredibly stringent protocols at the White House that we keep in place to keep the president, to keep everybody safe. Those go over and above CDC guidelines, and that includes ensuring that anyone who is going to be around the president is tested.” Over at the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki has been answering questions about US arms shipments to Ukraine, given military leaders’ assessments that the war against Russia could take years. “There are transfers of systems nearly every single day,” Psaki said, hours after the Ukraine defense minister Dymtro Zulebi told journalists in Brussels that there were only three items on his country’s wish list for the US and its allies: “Weapons, weapons and weapons.” “For every Russian tank in Ukraine, the United States will have, or has provided, 10 anti-tank systems. For every Russian armored vehicle in Ukraine, the United States will have provided about three anti-armor systems, if you factor in contributions from allies,” Psaki said. “The way this works is that the Ukrainian leaders request a range of assistance, they often provide us lists, we go through that list, we determine what we can provide. We provide a vast, vast majority of what they’re requesting [and] if we don’t have access to it, sometimes it’s Russian-made military equipment, we work with our allies and partners to see what they can provide.” Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the US supreme court shatters several glass ceilings in America’s long struggle to form a more perfect union. Not only will she be the first Black woman to sit on the court since it assembled in 1790. She will also be the first justice with experience as a public defender to join a bench that has hosted many former prosecutors. When Jackson takes her seat on the nine-justice panel, following Stephen Breyer’s retirement probably in June, she will also raise its female contingent to four – a historic number that brings a majority of female justices within reach. On a more personal level, her promotion to the supreme court is the fulfillment of her ambition to excel at the law which she has nurtured from a young age. It is the realization of the promise given to her by her parents, who were themselves brought up under the ignominies of racial segregation in the US south. Read more here: Vice-president Kamala Harris, who oversaw the senate vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson, said she was “overjoyed” at the result. “I am feeling overjoyed and I am feeling a deep sense of pride in who we are as a nation,” Harris told reporters as she was leaving the chamber, according to NPR. The White House has announced that Harris will join President Joe Biden for a press conference on the South Lawn tomorrow at 12.15pm to talk about Jackson’s confirmation. Supreme court scholars are weighing in with analysis on the Jackson confirmation, calling her a “worthy successor” to the retiring liberal justice Stephen Breyer. “She possesses all of the attributes that the US expects of supreme court justices, she has substantial relevant experience as a judge at the district and appellate levels of the federal judiciary, is highly intelligent, diligent and independent, and enjoys balanced judicial temperament. She amply displayed all of these phenomena throughout three grueling days of questioning,” Carl Tobias, Williams chair in law at the University of Richmond said. “Her confirmation will enhance the supreme court and the nation in many critical ways. Of course, her appointment is historic, as she is the first Black woman to serve, she will improve court diversity in terms of ethnicity, gender, ideology and experience. “Jackson [also] promises to be a mainstream justice, which is important, because the Court is more ideologically conservative than it has been in the last 80 years and may not reflect the will of the people. Her diverse experiences are also critical, as Justice Sotomayor is the only justice who served as a district judge and no present justice has engaged in criminal defense work, which Jackson did and which improves her decision making.” Professor Tobias added he was hopeful Jackson’s torrid confirmation process would lead to improvements in how future supreme court justices are seated. “Many Americans, including members of the judiciary committee, believe that the confirmation process has been deteriorating. The process has become overly politicized and partisan and senators asked Jackson too many questions that lacked relevance, seemed calculated to score political points ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, or were even improper or insulting. “I am cautiously optimistic that committee members and other senators will work on improvements in the process, which now can reflect poorly on the committee, the Senate, and the president and may erode public confidence in all three branches of federal government, but especially the court.” ABC News has tweeted an image of Ketanji Brown Jackson hugging with President Joe Biden, taken at the White House at the moment her supreme court confirmation vote passed the majority threshold. Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation represents “a tremendously historic day at the White House and in the country,” according to Joe Biden’s press secretary Jen Psaki. Speaking at her afternoon press briefing, Psaki said Biden had remained engaged through the entire confirmation process, talking with senators on both sides of the political divide. “This is a fulfillment of a promise the president made to the country. His time on the judiciary committee was defining for him and gave him historically exceptional preparation for what we would consider a smooth process, characterized by heavy engagement with both parties in the senate,” Psaki said. “He promised to choose a successor in the mold of Justice [Stephen] Breyer as Republicans and Democrats called for and after thorough consideration chose Judge Jackson, or Justice Jackson I guess we can now call her. “The President’s outreach continued at this stage, calling senators in both parties early about his choice. Out of the gate, he proved he had chosen someone in the tradition by immediately getting endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police and Judge Thomas Griffith [Biden’s appointee to the presidential commission on the supreme court], followed by procession of leading conservative legal minds and additional law enforcement organizations.” In Ketanji Brown Jackson, “President Biden picked the most extraordinary individual that I could think of in America,” the Democratic chair of the Senate judiciary committee, Dick Durbin, has said. “She turned out to be a pillar of strength to show grace and dignity and really won over the hearts of the American people,” he told reporters after the confirmation vote. “We want to make our justice system look much more like America. And today we took a giant step forward in giving this judge, Ketanji Brown Jackson, her lifetime chance to serve on the United States supreme court.” The president of the national association for the advancement of colored people (NAACP) Derrick Johnson has welcomed Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the supreme court. “In 2022, the first Black woman will finally sit on America’s supreme court. It has taken far too long, but President Biden promised and delivered,” he said in a statement. “Former NAACP Chief Counsel Thurgood Marshall broke down the wall when he was nominated and confirmed as the first Black American to sit on the Supreme Court. Today, Ketanji Brown Jackson shattered the glass ceiling. “While history has been made today, the unjust hurdles Black women like Ketanji Brown Jackson face each and every day were centerstage throughout the hearing process. The racist attacks were disgusting and shameful, but, as Black women do, Ketanji Brown Jackson outshined the hate. Today and every day, we celebrate Black women. “The NAACP remains committed to tearing down the racist obstacles that continue to obstruct paths for far too many Americans, especially Black women, throughout our nation. While we celebrate today, tomorrow we are back at work tackling student debt, voting and reproductive rights, climate change, and police reform, so that everyone in America can realize their dream.” Finally, Rand Paul, unsurprisingly, makes his vote a no, making Ketanji Brown Jackson’s historic confirmation vote final at 53-47. “On this vote the yays are 53, the nays are 47, and this nomination is confirmed,” the vice-president Kamala Harris, said, acting in her role of Senate president. The chamber immediately erupted into cheers. The final vote tally for Ketanji Brown Jackson’s supreme court confirmation is not yet in. The Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul is, for reasons that are still unclear, yet to cast his vote. Regardless, Jackson’s confirmation is a done deal, with the tally standing at 53-46 in her favor. She will be sworn in sometime in late June or early July, when the liberal justice Stephen Breyer, whom she is replacing, retires from the bench. The US Senate has voted to confirm Joe Biden’s pick Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to a seat on the US supreme court. The historic vote makes her the first Black woman to sit on the nation’s highest court. Full story here: The Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer is giving his closing remarks ahead of the chamber’s vote on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s supreme court confirmation. “This is a wonderful day, a joyous day and an inspiring day for the Senate, the supreme court, and the United States of America,” he said. “It’s been a dark two years with Covid... but even in the darkest times there are bright lights. Today is one of the brightest lights. Let us hope it is a metaphor, an indication of many more bright lights. “Every step of her upbringing and career, Ketanji Brown Jackson ranked one of the highest achievers.” She will, he said, “enhance the court’s ability to preserve the basic truth in our country that all deserve equal justice under the law, from the privilege to the impoverished.” Schumer acknowledged that Jackson will become the first Black woman to sit on the panel. “This judge belongs on the supreme court. By that I mean something very specific. In our nation’s history, 115 individuals have been confirmed by this body to serve on the supreme court. Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first African American woman ever to hold the title. The kids will open textbooks and see pictures of Justice Jackson among the highest ranks.” New York’s attorney general Letitia James has asked a state judge to hold Donald Trump in contempt of court for refusing to turn over documents she subpoenaed for her civil investigation into the former US president’s business operations. In the court filing, James said Trump failed to abide by his earlier agreement to comply “in full” with her subpoena for documents and information by 31 March. James is seeking that Trump be fined $10,000 a day until he complies. Last week, James asked the appeals court to uphold a lower-court ruling requiring Trump to answer questions under oath, after a civil investigation uncovered evidence he may have misstated the value of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers on financial statements for more than a decade. “The evidence collected to date suggests that financial statements, tax submissions, loan guarantees, and other documents contain material misstatements and omissions,” James’s office said in court papers. James is also seeking to uphold a ruling forcing Trump’s two oldest children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr, to testify. Both have been executives at the Trump Organization. Here’s a handy explainer, courtesy of CNN, about how the supreme court confirmation process works. Essentially, Judge Ketanji Brown’s lifetime appointment to the bench will be confirmed by a simple majority vote of the 100 US senators in the chamber this afternoon. The US Senate is currently evenly split, between 50 Republicans, and the 48 Democrats and two independents who usually vote with them. In the event of a 50-50 tie in the Senate confirmation vote, the Democratic vice-president Kamala Harris would be called upon to break the tie and promote Jackson to the supreme court. Three Republicans, however, and two at least two moderate Democrats whose votes might have been in the balance, have publicly declared their support for Jackson. So, even if there are no more defections, Harris’s intervention will not be necessary, and the vote for Jackson would be at least 53-47 in her favor. That’s the same margin that senators voted in the last hour to end discussion on Jackson’s nomination and advance the process to the final Senate floor vote. Assuming she is confirmed, Jackson will be seated later this summer, when the liberal justice Stephen Breyer, whose retirement led to Joe Biden nominating Jackson for his seat, stands down after 22 years’ service. Supreme court: key preliminary vote passes to limit debate in Senate The Senate has now voted 53 to 47 to limit debate on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the supreme court. The cloture vote is a key part of the process with the final confirmation vote expected later Thursday in the early afternoon in Washington DC. “No one can argue that Justice Brown Jackson is not qualified to be confirmed,” said Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, in the chamber just after the vote. “Judge Jackson has earned the president’s nomination, and has earned confirmation from the Senate.” He criticized the way Republicans conducted themselves in the nomination hearings. Shortly earlier he tweeted that it was a day to “make history”. She left it late, but the Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate Democrat, has just announced she will vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court. News of Sinema’s potential vote has been closely watched. Along with fellow moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the two have combined to derail several of Joe Biden’s policy goals in the US Senate this term. Manchin declared his intention to support Jackson last week, and with at least three Republicans on board, Sinema’s vote was not in the end crucial - although it would have been a surprise for her to have voted no. A cloture vote to end Senate debate on Jackson’s nomination is due imminently, and the final confirmation vote is scheduled for about 1.45pm. The House speaker Nancy Pelosi has tested positive for Covid-19, her office has just announced. A statement from the Speaker’s spokesperson Drew Hammill reads: After testing negative this week, Speaker Pelosi received a positive test result for Covid-19 and is currently asymptomatic. The Speaker is fully vaccinated and boosted, and is thankful for the robust protection the vaccine has provided. The Speaker will quarantine consistent with CDC guidance, and encourages everyone to get vaccinated, boosted and test regularly.” Pelosi, 82, was with president Joe Biden, and the former president Barack Obama, at the White House on Tuesday as he signed an executive order extending the affordable care act. Few of the attendees were masked. She was with Biden again yesterday at the White House when the president signed the postal services act. The White House press secretary Jen Psaki is certain to be asked about it at her lunchtime briefing today. Obama has recently recovered from Covid-19. Pelosi was not an attendee at the Gridiron dinner in Washington DC on Saturday, following which several Biden administration officials tested positive, including the US attorney general Merrick Garland and commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, as well as Democratic congressmen Adam Schiff and Joaquin Castro. The justice department is blocking the 6 January House investigation from accessing more than a dozen boxes of records from the Trump White House, CNN is reporting, fueling speculation they are the subject of its own criminal inquiry. According to the network, National Archives general counsel Gary Stern wrote to the House oversight committee saying it was unable to respond to a request for information from the panel about the records based on the Archives’ “consultation” with the justice department. The bipartisan panel is looking into Trump’s efforts to overturn his election defeat, including his incitement of the deadly 6 January Capitol attack. The 15 boxes of records in question are those Trump is said to have taken with him to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, in January 2021 when he left office, in apparent violation of federal records laws. The development is a bump for the House panel, which has made significant headway in recent weeks as it attempts to establish Trump’s culpability. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, and her husband Jared Kushner, both former White House advisers, have given testimony in the past few days. The justice department, and the US attorney general Merrick Garland, have come under fire for perceived slow progress in its own inquiry. CNN said the justice department had declined to comment, but that it was common practice to limit information that government agencies share with Congress while an investigation is ongoing. On Wednesday, the House voted to hold former Trump advisers Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro in contempt for refusing subpoenas to testify to the panel.

The conversions are “a warning sign” for Democrats as they attempt to keep control of Congress in November’s midterm elections, the Reuters report states. Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state that backed Joe Biden narrowly in 2020, is likely to see a furious scramble for one of its Senate seats with the retirement of Pat Toomey, the only statewide elected Republican. “I just got fed up and just felt like there has to be a better way,” Beth Jones, 48, a retired Philadelphia police officer who last month registered as a Republican, told Reuters, citing crime and high inflation for her decision. Jones said she had voted Democratic for three decades. Reuters said it examined registration data in six states that could see tight US Senate races in November and which generally require voters to be members of a party to participate in nominating contests. While each state tracks voter registration differently, the review pointed to Republican gains in four of those states, and no substantial difference in two of them. In Pennsylvania, Republicans have converted four Democrats for every Republican who has switched the other way, according to the Pennsylvania’s state department data. The conversion rate is well above 2016, Reuters says, when Republicans took the White House, House of Representatives and Senate. A bipartisan group of senators wants Joe Biden to reverse the decision to end the Trump-era immigration policy that blocked refugees at the US southern border because of the coronavirus pandemic. Axios is reporting that the group of five Democratic and six Republican senators will introduce a bill later today that would prevent the Biden administration from lifting Title 42 without a detailed plan in place to stop an expected surge of migrants at the border. “It is evident that the current preparations and plans for the end of Title 42 aren’t adequate,” Axios quoted the bill’s co-sponsor, the Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, stating she met with the homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday. The Biden administration announced last week that the policy introduced by Trump in 2020 would end on 23 May, painting it as a public health move because the pandemic was easing. But the announcement has received massive pushback, and threatens to derail negotiations in Congress over a relief package for vaccines, treatments and testing, the Washington Post reported. The White House wanted $22.5bn, and a bipartisan panel of senators appeared to have settled on $10bn, before the Title 42 prompted a furious reaction from Republicans. Adding to the acrimony, the Texas governor Greg Abbott says he’s going to round up busloads of undocumented immigrants and send them to Washington DC for Joe Biden to deal with, according to CNN. Read about the impact of the Title 42 decision here: Big cities in California spent large portions of their federal Covid relief money on police departments, a review of public records has revealed, with several cities prioritizing police funding by a wide margin. As part of the American Rescue Plan Act (Arpa), the Biden administration’s signature stimulus package, the US government sent funds to cities to help them fight coronavirus and support local recovery efforts. The money, officials said, could be used to fund a range of services, including public health and housing initiatives, healthcare workers’ salaries, infrastructure investments and aid for small businesses. But most large California cities spent millions of Arpa dollars on law enforcement. Some also gave police money from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (Cares) Act, adopted in 2020 under Donald Trump. In a state with severe income inequality and a dramatically worsening homelessness crisis, the stimulus spending has sparked backlash from community organizers who argue that the funds should have gone directly to civilians and that police should have accepted cuts. “It was called the ‘American Rescue Plan’, but you’re telling me that what needed to be rescued was the police department?” said Stephen “Cue” Jn-Marie, a pastor and activist at Skid Row in LA. “The city’s kneejerk reaction is always to use law enforcement to respond to everything … and the police forces keep getting larger.” Read the full story here: The Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has scheduled a 1.45pm vote for the confirmation of Joe Biden’s pick Ketanji Brown Jackson to be confirmed as the first Black female associate justice of the US Supreme Court. In a tweet, Schumer said: “It will be a joyous day for America!” Despite a fractious and sometimes farcical hearing in the House two weeks ago, and the announcement of high-profile Republican senator Lindsey Graham that he wouldn’t support her now (despite voting for her earlier elevation to the US appeals court), her confirmation is all but certain. Three Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have announced they will vote for her, assuring Biden of a prized bipartisan appointment in the equally divided chamber. Jackson’s elevation to the nation’s highest court, replacing the long-serving liberal justice Stephen Breyer, who is retiring, is more than just symbolic. The lifetime appointment at the age of 51 could see Jackson on the bench for decades, and she will likely prove a vocal counter to the panel’s current 6-3 conservative majority. The Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate judiciary, praised Jackson’s “impeccable qualifications” on Monday, and said her experience as a public defender would bring a “missing perspective to the court”. “Hers is a uniquely American family story, how much hope and promise can be achieved in just one generation,” Durbin said. “I’m proud we can bear witness to it.” Jackson will become only the sixth woman to sit on the Supreme Court in its more than 200-year history. Read the highlights of Jackson’s confirmation hearings here: Good morning blog readers, and welcome to what will be a busy Thursday. It’s a big day at the US supreme court, where Joe Biden’s pick Ketanji Brown Jackson is almost certain to be confirmed as its newest associate justice in a Senate vote scheduled for 1.45pm.

Ketanji Brown Jackson makes history as first Black woman confirmed to US supreme court,2022-04-07T18:01:26Z,Lauren Gambino and Joan E Greve in Washington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7knj,"Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal appeals court judge, was confirmed to the supreme court on Thursday, overcoming a rancorous Senate approval process and earning bipartisan approval to become the first Black woman to serve as a justice on the high court in its more than 200-year history. After weeks of private meetings and days of public testimony, marked by intense sparring over judicial philosophy and personal reflections on race in America, Jackson earned narrow – but notable – bipartisan support to become the 116th justice of the supreme court. The vote was 53 to 47, with all Democrats in favor. They were joined by three moderate Republicans, senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who defied deep opposition within their party to support Joe Biden’s nominee. Their support was a welcome result for the White House, which had been intent on securing a bipartisan confirmation. Jackson, who currently serves on the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, will replace Stephen Breyer, 83, the most senior member of the court’s liberal bloc. Breyer, for whom Jackson clerked early in her legal career, said he intends to retire from the court this summer. At 51, Jackson is young enough to serve on the court for decades. Her ascension, however, will do little to tilt the ideological balance of the high court, dominated by a 6-3 conservative majority. But it does mean for the first time in the court’s history that white men are in the minority. Kamala Harris, the first Black woman to serve as US vice-president, presided over the Senate vote as Jackson became the first Black woman to join the supreme court, underscoring the historic nature of her confirmation. Harris called for the final vote on Jackson’s nomination with a smile on her face, and the chamber broke into loud applause when the judge was confirmed. “Today, we are taking a giant, bold and important step on the well-trodden path to fulfilling our country’s founding promises,” Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said just before the final vote. “This is a great moment for Judge Jackson. But it is an even greater moment for America as we rise to a more perfect union.” The White House has announced that Biden, Harris and Jackson will deliver remarks on Friday to celebrate the confirmation. Jackson and Biden watched the final Senate vote together in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. Biden shared a photo taken with Jackson at the White House, saying on Twitter: “Judge Jackson’s confirmation was a historic moment for our nation. We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America. She will be an incredible justice, and I was honored to share this moment with her.” Assailing Jackson’s record, but acknowledging Republicans did not have the votes to stop her confirmation, minority leader Mitch McConnell implored the judge to embrace the textualist approach of conservative justices. “The soon-to-be justice can either satisfy her radical fan club or help preserve the judiciary that Americans need, but not both,” McConnell said ahead of the vote on Thursday. “I’m afraid the nominee’s record tells us which is likely, but I hope judge Jackson proves me wrong.” Her confirmation to the lifetime post represents the fulfillment of a promise Biden made to his supporters at the nadir of his 2020 campaign for president, when he vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the supreme court, if elected president and a vacancy arose. The opportunity presented itself earlier this year, at another low point for Biden, with momentous domestic and foreign challenges weighing on his presidency. During the public hearings, Jackson vowed to be an independent justice who would seek to ensure that the words inscribed on the marbled supreme court building – Equal Justice Under the Law – were a “reality and not just an ideal”. With her parents and daughters present, Jackson recounted for the Senate judiciary committee her family’s generational journey, as the daughter of public school teachers raised in the segregated south who would rise to become a justice on a court that once denied Black Americans citizenship. Yet any hope by the White House that Jackson’s historic nomination might defuse some of the bitter partisanship that senators lament has turned the process into a “circus” quickly evaporated. With an eye to the November midterm elections, Republicans led an aggressive campaign against the judge during her confirmation hearings and in conservative media, raising questions about her record in an effort to paint her as an “activist judge” who is soft on crime. They used the confirmation proceedings to air conservative grievances about past supreme court nominations and to wage culture war battles over critical race theory, crime and transgender women in sports. Couched in thinly coded appeals to racism and the far-right fringes with nods to the QAnon conspiracy theory, some Republicans accused Jackson of being too lenient on child sexual abuse offenders, claims she forcefully rebutted “as a mother and a judge”. Legal experts have said her decisions in such criminal cases were within the mainstream while independent factcheckers concluded that the attacks were misleading and a distortion of her record. Democrats, and the handful of Republicans who supported her, praised her qualifications and demeanor, and in particular the restraint she showed during some stinging exchanges with conservative senators. They sought to defend her record, noting that her sentencing record was within the mainstream of the federal judiciary, while emphasizing the support she had earned from within the legal community, including among conservative justices, and her endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police, which cited her family’s law enforcement background. In a mark of just how polarizing the process of confirming a supreme court nominee has become, the Senate judiciary committee deadlocked along party lines over her nomination. The resulting tie prompted Democrats to execute a rare procedural maneuver to “discharge” her nomination from the committee to the floor, with a vote by the full Senate. The NAACP said the vote by 11 Republicans against Jackson’s nomination was a “stain” on the committee. The final Senate vote on her confirmation was among the closest in supreme court history. A graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School, Jackson served on the independent US sentencing commission, an agency that develops sentencing guidelines, before becoming a federal judge. While she shares an elite background with the other justices, her work as a public defender sets her apart. The last justice with experience representing criminal defendants was Thurgood Marshall, the towering civil rights lawyer who became the first Black member of the supreme court."
Leaked emails reveal Manchester City received payments from Abu Dhabi,2022-04-07T19:28:53Z,Paul MacInnes,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7q2x,"Emails have been released that appear to show the state of Abu Dhabi facilitating payments to Manchester City, reigniting the controversy that led to the club receiving a ban from European competition that was ultimately overturned at the court of arbitration for sport. According to documents published by Der Spiegel, City liaised with a government agency in the Gulf State to fulfil payments to the club owed by a private company under the control of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family and City’s owner since 2008. It comes alongside further claims that the Premier League is investigating the possibility City paid transfer fees for underage players and supplemented the wages of their former manager, Roberto Mancini, by means of a secret consultancy contract. City would not comment on the allegations but sources close to the club said the new reports were a continuation of an “orchestrated campaign” and part of “an endless attempt to damage us”. Previous allegations made by Der Spiegel which suggested City were the beneficiaries of inflated sponsorship deals directly funded by Sheikh Mansour led to the club receiving a two-year ban from the Champions League. That ban was subsequently cancelled on appeal by Cas. The new reports are based in part on a further tranche of documents released by the Football Leaks group. They show a number of communications between Simon Pearce, a member of the City board and vice-chairman of sister club Melbourne City FC, and Omar Awad, the finance director of the Executive Affairs Authority, an Abu Dhabi government agency. In one email from 2013, Pearce is shown to ask Awad to forward a payment of £31.7m to City from a bank account belonging to the Abu Dhabi Investment and Development Group (ADUG). This is a fund owned by Sheikh Mansour but which UAE officials have consistently said is a private fund and unconnected to the state. Further club communications published by Der Spiegel but previously reported on by Reuters show Pearce communicating from an EEA.gov.ae email address. One such mail is sent to Pearce from City’s then head of finance Andrew Widdowson on 7 December 2012 and asks for Pearce to “help in facilitating the amounts due via the Abu Dhabi partners”. Widdowson then goes on to specify sums of money to be directed through sponsors Etihad and Etisalat, two Abu Dhabi businesses. “I want to ensure that they come through the correct channels and are not picked up as separate sources of funding,” Widdowson writes. Der Spiegel also reports that the Premier League is continuing to investigate City after nearly three years, in what the magazine claims is a three-pronged pursuit. Alongside questions over the involvement of the Abu Dhabi state in making payments to City, the Premier League are also reported to be looking into claims City recruited the then 14-year-old player Brahim Díaz, contrary to Fifa’s rules over the movement of minors. Der Spiegel claims that ADUG also paid €360,000 in compensation to Díaz’s youth team, indirectly via Spanish intermediaries. The Premier League are further reported to be investigating claims that were also part of the Football Leaks files, which appear to show that former manager Mancini both received a salary from City and a larger annual “consultancy” fee from Al Jazira Club, a group controlled by Sheikh Mansour. The supplementary fee was allegedly devised in order to circumvent Uefa’s Financial Fair Play rules. The Premier League would not comment on the Der Spiegel allegations, nor the investigation into City which was confirmed as ongoing in a ruling by the court of appeal last year. In a statement released in 2019, the Premier League said it would not comment on the investigation further."
"The wealth of Akshata Murty, Indian heiress and wife of Rishi Sunak",2022-04-07T19:01:46Z,Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z4x,"Akshata Murthy is richer than the Queen and owns almost as many houses. The Indian heiress, and her husband, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, own a property portfolio of four homes worth an estimated £15m – including an LA penthouse overlooking the beach where Baywatch was filmed. The couple, who married in a lavish two-day Indian ceremony in 2009 and have two children, live predominantly in a flat above 10 Downing Street but also own two other properties in the capital and a £2m Grade II-listed Georgian mansion in Yorkshire. Murty, 42, is sitting on an estimated £690m fortune held in shares in Infosys, the IT giant founded by her billionaire father. That makes her much richer than the Queen, who has about £365m. It was revealed this week that despite living in the UK for the past nine years, Murty claims non-domicile status, allowing her to avoid paying UK tax on the £11.5m-a-year she collects in dividend from the overseas IT fortune. Using the “non-dom” scheme – which is also used by the now-sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and the Daily Mail owner, Lord Rothermere – has allowed Murty to not pay up an estimated £20m in tax that would have been due on £54m of dividends earned over the past seven-and-a-half years if she decided to pay UK tax in full. Her spokesperson suggested that Murty, as an Indian citizen, had no choice but to be “treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”. However, all UK residents must actively apply for non-dom status by filing in government tax form SA109 to claim the tax relief. Murty is also paying a £30,000 “annual charge” to the Treasury for the right to maintain her non-dom status beyond a seven-year cut off period. The non-domicile scheme, first introduced under King George III in 1799, is legal and can be used to avoid paying UK tax on income from overseas rents and bank interest as well as foreign dividends and inheritance tax. Non-doms can live in the UK all year round. The UK’s tax rules are set by Murty’s husband, the chancellor. In his spring statement last month, Sunak raised the tax burden on UK taxpayers to its highest level since the 1940s, even as the population faces the biggest squeeze on living standards on record. The Resolution Foundation thinktank suggested Sunak’s package of measures would push 1.3 million people, including 500,000 children, into poverty. Before they moved into Downing Street – when Sunak was appointed chancellor in 2020 – their main residence was a five-bedroom mews house in Kensington. The property, which they bought in 2010 for a reported £4.5m, is now estimated by estate agents to be worth more than £7m. They also own a flat on the nearby Old Brompton Road, which is said to be used by family and friends when they come to visit. In the picturesque North Yorkshire village of Kirby Sigston, the couple own a Grade II-listed Georgian manor house estimated to be worth £2m. The house, which they bought for £1.5m before Sunak became MP for the Richmond (Yorks) constituency, is undergoing a £250,000 development to add an indoor swimming pool, hot tub, tennis club and gym complex. Both Murty and Sunak are fitness fanatics, who have spoken of dawn workouts before work every day. The couple were last year granted planning permission for a single storey L-shaped building in a paddock beside the lake at their Yorkshire home set in 12 acres near Northallerton. The building project includes a 40ft by 16ft indoor pool, changing area, hot tub and dance room with a mirrored wall. The building is to be clad with local stone and topped with a Welsh slate roof to make it appear like “a stone-built ancillary building that has undergone renovation and modification”. However at the planning meeting last year, the councillor John Noone said: “It doesn’t look like an agricultural building to me, it looks like a rather large bungalow. I think it does actually have an impact on the setting of the Grade II manor house. When we went on the site visit you could clearly see the manor house from where we were stood.” In California, where Murty and Sunak met, she owns a $7.2m (£5.5m) penthouse apartment that boasts sweeping views of the world-famous Santa Monica pier and the Pacific Ocean beyond. Estate agents for the six-storey building, built in 2013, boast that the penthouse comes with “large private outdoor terraces unlike anything ever seen before on Ocean Avenue”. Residents of the Waverly complex on Ocean Avenue are promised “the epitome of urban Santa Monica beach living” with “stunning views of the Santa Monica mountain”, where you “wake up to the sound of waves crashing against the shore”. The building, designed by KTGY architects and with interiors by the LA designers Marmol Radziner, offers an around-the-clock concierge and a fitness centre “stocked with the latest equipment for those looking to improve their cardiovascular or muscular endurance”. There is even a “pet spa” where residents’ “furry companions can get pampered”. Murty, who was born in India, spent most of her late-teens and 20s in LA. She went to the city’s private liberal Claremont McKenna College, where she studied economics and French, before moving to the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. She worked for Deloitte and Unilever before studying for an MBA at Stanford University. It was at Stanford that she met Sunak, who had won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship. Within four years, they were married in a two-day ceremony in Bengaluru, attended by cricketing royalty including the Indian spinner Anil Kumble and the family of Rahul Dravid, the former captain of the national cricket team. Her father, NR Narayana Murthy, the billionaire founder of Infosys, said he was a “little sad and jealous” when Akshata first told him of her new life partner. “But when I met Rishi and found him to be all that you had described him to be – brilliant, handsome and, most importantly, honest – I understood why you let your heart be stolen.” As well as the Infosys stake, the couple also own London-based Catamaran Ventures UK, which invests in startups “with the view to future capital growth and income distributions”. Sunak transferred his shares to her just before entering parliament, and she is now the sole owner. She has held direct stakes in at least six other UK companies, including the gentlemen’s outfitters New &amp; Lingwood, which measures Etonians for their tailcoats and sells silk dressing gowns for £2,500 each. Murtyhas also held shares in a UK business that operates Jamie Oliver’s Pizzeria, Jamie’s Italian and Wendy’s outlets in India, the nanny agency Koru Kids, and the gym operator Digme Fitness, where she is a director. Both New &amp; Lingwood and Digme furloughed staff during the pandemic. Soroco, a software company co-founded by her brother, lists Murty as a director of its UK arm."
Eric Pickles asks Grenfell inquiry not to waste his time but gets death toll wrong,2022-04-07T19:21:53Z,Hibaq Farah,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7q2d,"A former cabinet minister has challenged the Grenfell inquiry not to waste his time while giving evidence, before getting the death toll from the disaster wrong. Lord Pickles, who served as secretary of state at the then Department for Communities and Local Government between 2010 and 2015, sparked anger after he advised the inquiry’s senior counsel to “use your time wisely” as he had an extremely busy day. Pickles said: “By all means sir, feel free to ask me as many questions as you like, but could I respectfully remind you that you did promise that we would be away this morning and I have changed my schedules to fit this in.” The first report from the Grenfell inquiry found that lessons from the 2006 Lakanal House tower block fire had not been learned by the time of the Grenfell disaster. In response to this, Pickles said that he had come to the view that a swifter response to the coroner’s recommendations in 2013 would not “have made any difference whatsoever”. “This isn’t about deregulation,” he added, but the “nameless victims” and “96 people” who were killed. 72 people were killed in the Grenfell fire, all of whom have been named. The 96 figure Pickles used is the same number of people originally thought to have died in the Hillsborough disaster. The inquiry’s chief counsel, Richard Millett QC, said: “You were spectacularly out of touch with what was happening in your department.” Pickles responded that it was “uncharacteristically unjust” for counsel to say that, and that his was an “enormous department”. Millett said: “Your department was always subject to the deregulatory agenda and you are now seeking to recast that narrative and to underplay what was in truth an enthusiasm by your government for a deregulatory agenda, which led to a complete absence of proper checks and balances so far as concerns life safety.” Pickles replied: “I think that would be unkind.” At the end of the hearing, the inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, thanked him for his time, saying: “I am sorry that it interfered with your arrangements for today, but there were things that we needed to ask you.” The survivors’ group Grenfell United criticised Pickles for what it called his “utter disregard” for victims and called for his removal from government and the House of Lords. “His utter disregard for what happened and to those no longer with us is horrifying, given that he had the ability as minister of housing to reform building safety,” they said. “Eric Pickles must be removed from government and the Lords. Otherwise, government continues to show the contempt it’s always had for people’s safety in this country.” Yesterday several UK housebuilders signed a government-led pledge to fix fire safety problems in apartment blocks built since 1992. The new Building Safety Pledge commits developers to remove unsafe cladding and address fire-safety issues on all buildings of 11 metres tall or higher which were developed in the last 30 years, and not to claim any funds from the government’s Building Safety Fund."
The Girl from Plainville: the unease of TV’s latest true crime hit,2022-04-07T19:10:46Z,Adrian Horton,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7n65,"The reasons to watch and to question The Girl from Plainville, an eight-part Hulu mini-series based on the infamous “texting suicide” case from mid-2010s Massachusetts, are both contained in the final scene of the first episode. The camera hovers behind Michelle Carter, played mesmerizingly by Elle Fanning, who stares at herself in the mirror, face distorted by grief. It’s summer 2014, a few weeks after Conrad “Coco” Roy III (Colton Ryan), with whom Carter had a years-long text-based relationship, killed himself via carbon monoxide poisoning in a K-mart parking lot. Michelle appears to be practicing a speech for his memorial. “I loved him, and he loved me, and he loved all of you guys. I know he did,” she says through tears. But then the tears abruptly stop. Michelle turns around to her laptop to restart a scene from Glee in which Rachel Berry, played by Lea Michele, sings a tribute to Finn Hudson, the character played by Michele’s on and off-screen boyfriend, Cory Monteith, who died of an accidental overdose in 2013. Michelle’s heartfelt words are actually, we realize, merely heartfelt mimicry; her monologue is lifted near-verbatim from Glee. Michelle follows Lea Michele’s monologue to the end of the scene, singing To Make You Feel My Love with operatic gestures, voice raw. It’s a fascinatingly circular, deeply uncomfortable scene: a teenage character obsessed with a famous TV character inspired by tragic real-life events – a disturbing, weird detail lifted from the real-life Michelle Carter story – played for provocation on a TV show assumedly aimed to sketch in the blanks of a well-publicized, polarizing tragedy. There’s a lot here. Is Michelle a psychopath looking for sympathy? A delusional narcissist? An unwell teenage girl so devoid of self-worth that she psychotically over-identifies with a fictional character? Someone deeply moved by television? You could find evidence for any of those readings. The moment is The Girl from Plainville at its best: an exploration of the human behind a seemingly monstrous act (Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a precedent-setting case in 2017 for telling Roy, in several text messages for weeks before his death, to kill himself). It’s also indicative of the fundamental awkwardness of this show, an overlong deluge of unease which gestures at a lot of thorny, circular issues but barely digs into the mess of the real story. Some of this discomfort – the mysterious, bizarre darkness of abnormal psychology, the power of digital communications to warp one’s sense of reality, too-strong identifications with celebrities – feels earned, suggestive, rich. But a lot of it stems from the show’s premise, in making what is fundamentally entertainment out of the deeply tragic digital union of two very wounded, very fragile teenagers. The Girl from Plainville, as a recent true crime series, continually raises the question for its justification – what does this add to a story we already know? Can entertainment illuminate without exploiting? – and doesn’t seem to know the answer. The Girl from Plainville, created by Liz Hannah and Patrick Macmanus, exists at the intersection of several popular TV subgenres. It’s another example of a 2010s headline turned popular documentary/podcast/exposé turned limited series – a narrative second draft of history, as in The Dropout, WeCrashed, Super Pumped and Inventing Anna. (The Girl from Plainville is based on an Esquire article on the real trial, which is also the subject of the 2019 two-part HBO documentary I Love You, Now Die, directed by Erin Lee Carr.) It’s interested in the psychology of chronic lies, such as in the aforementioned true-scam shows, HBO’s Winning Time (on a business level) and Hulu’s The Act (about an infamous 2010s Munchausen-by-proxy story, also explored in Carr’s first documentary, Mommy Dead and Dearest). It offers a complicating, if not redemptive, character study of a publicly villainized woman, a la Pam &amp; Tommy, Impeachment: American Crime Story or documentaries on Britney Spears, Janet Jackson and Lorena Bobbitt. There’s the interest in teen mental health and suicide, as in the controversial Netflix hit 13 Reasons Why and the moral panic over HBO’s hit Euphoria. In The Girl from Plainville and most of the aforementioned shows, there’s also the evergreen and uncanny frisson of seeing a well-known actor transform through hair, makeup, costume and prosthetics into a well-known figure. In other words, much of what The Girl from Plainville is doing is familiar, on a thematic and narrative level; it employs some well-worn prestige TV tropes for better (an interest in the brittle grief of Coco’s mom Lynn, played wonderfully by Chloe Sevigny; meticulous costuming and set design that captures the vibe of suburban 2012-2014) and for worse (muddled multiple timelines, a lagging eight-hour runtime that could have been four). The show is most novel and intriguing in its attempt to convey the emotional realism of consistent texting. In the first three episodes – the immediate aftermath of Coco’s suicide on one timeline, and the initiation of their relationship on a Florida vacation on the other – the phone screen is a haunting presence. Michelle hovers over hers with near-religious fervor, typing and retyping and staring at messages; Lynn’s grief is patterned by texts and calls; Coco buries his chronic depression and loneliness into his phone. By the fourth episode, which dropped last week (the remaining four will air weekly), Coco and Michelle are deep in their secret correspondence – nebulous, toxic, psychoactive. The couple, who only met in person a handful of times, were less lovers than voices in each other’s heads. The show captures some of that blurriness, and why adults just didn’t get it, by putting the texts in the actors’ mouths. Their digital conversations (pulled, it seems, from the real texts) play out as fantasy sequences, one imagining the other in the room with them, staring ravenously at them, as they type. But we barely get to feel it, as the spliced timeline undercuts their exchanges. A fourth episode scene in which Coco tells Michelle that he attempted suicide, for example, cuts to a standard procedural scene in which the prosecutor mulls over zero-sum strategy for how to best pursue Michelle at trial. It’s a frustrating watch; the show’s quality, particularly Fanning and Ryan’s instinctive performances, masks the shallowness of too many ideas, not enough clarity. The first half of the season mostly keeps Michelle a cipher, perhaps necessary for a person who has never participated in a formal interview since her 2015 indictment and did not speak at trial, but an ultimately uncomfortable decision. The intentional, interesting discomfort – reconciling what Michelle said with the vulnerable character on-screen – quickly elides with discomfort over the whole project. Michelle Carter was 17 years old when this all happened. There’s a version of this story that is even more sympathetic to her, a girl who long struggled with eating disorders and anxiety (suggested but not overt in early episodes) who also experienced suicidal ideation as a teen. How much creative license is fair with these real stories? Which truth gets the most bearing? Does audience or truth matter more? These are all messy questions without easy answers, and I say that as someone who will watch the whole series. It’s fitting, I suppose, for an incredibly messy story; the deeper you go – and with all the coverage of the trial, its thousands of pages of text message records, you can go very deep – the messier it gets. Yet you can somehow watch The Girl from Plainville and forget how tragic this whole story is, which is maybe the most uneasy thing of all. The Girl from Plainville is on Hulu on Tuesdays and will air in the UK later this year"
Akshata Murty may have avoided up to £20m in tax with non-dom status,2022-04-07T15:21:39Z,"Peter Walker, Kalyeena Makortoff,  Graeme Wearden, Jessica Elgot and Rupert Neate",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zjp,"Rishi Sunak’s wife has potentially avoided up to £20m in UK tax by being non-domiciled and pays £30,000 a year to keep the status – revelations that come amid growing political pressure on the chancellor. Akshata Murty gets about £11.5m a year in dividends from a stake in an Indian IT firm and declares non-dom status, which allows people to avoid tax on foreign earnings, it emerged on Wednesday. On Thursday her spokesperson said all necessary tax was paid by Murty but declined to say where, as that information was not “relevant”. They conceded it was possible for someone in the multimillionaire’s position to take advantage of tax havens on income earned outside the UK. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said it would be “breathtaking hypocrisy” if Murty had been reducing her liabilities while the chancellor was raising taxes on others amid a cost of living crisis. The row risks further damaging Sunak’s carefully honed brand among voters and Conservative MPs, already hit by last month’s spring statement, with a former minister warning the timing was especially bad coming days after the national insurance rise came into force. Murty has collected about 5.4bn Indian rupees (£54.5m) in dividends from Infosys, the Indian-headquartered IT business founded by her father, over the past seven and a half years, the period for which there is public data. Non-dom status for that whole period could have saved her about £20m in UK taxes. Last year she collected dividends of £11.6m. As a higher rate UK taxpayer she would have been expected to pay 38.1% tax on the payout, which works out at £4.4m. Before 2016, the rate was 30.6%. It rose to 39.35% this week. One factor which could potentially reduce the total Murty would have been eligible to pay would be any reduction under double tax treaties between the UK and India, tax experts said. Murty’s spokesperson said they had no comment on the £20m figure beyond reiterating she paid relevant taxes on UK and overseas incomes. They accepted that people with such tax arrangements could theoretically minimise payments using tax havens, while saying they had no comment as to whether Murty did this. Murty has previously collected other dividend income via the tax haven of Mauritius, which does not tax dividends. The spokesperson also declined to elaborate on the initial explanation for Murty’s non-dom tax status – the fact she has Indian citizenship – when this would still mean such a tax arrangement was a choice. Labour wrote to Sunak with a series of questions on his wife’s tax position. James Murray, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, wrote that it was “in the vital public interest” that he provide clarity on issues including whether he had benefited from his wife’s status, how long she had claimed it and how much she had saved. “As chancellor it is crucial you both follow the rules and lead by example,” Murray said. “Any impression that there is one set of rules favouring a few, and another for everyone else, threatens the integrity of tax policy in our country.” The Liberal Democrats said the case showed a law which bars MPs and peers from having non-dom status should be extended to spouses to avoid any risk of conflicts of interest. There was also concern from some Conservative MPs. A former minister said: “The perception is [an attitude of] ‘what is the problem?’ Here is someone worth £3bn who has a different tax arrangement. I’m sure everything is above board but that’s not the point.” Another Tory MP, a Boris Johnson loyalist, said it would be hard for MPs to stomach given Sunak had put up taxes. “There’s this guy, as rich as Croesus, putting up taxes when people are worrying about the next gas bill.” While Murty’s spokesperson characterised her tax status as a function of her Indian citizenship, tax experts said non-dom status is not automatic but a choice. Prof Richard Murphy, a Sheffield University academic who co-founded the Tax Justice Network, said: “Domicile has nothing to do with a person’s nationality. In other words, the claims made in the statement issued by Ms Murty are wrong.” Mike Warburton, formerly tax director at accountants Grant Thornton, said Murty was entitled to Indian tax domicile because of her father and because she was born there, saying it was “entirely legal and entirely appropriate” for her to do this. He said: “I don’t know, of course, but it may be that those shares are held in an offshore trust, possibly set up by her father. If I had been advising her, I would have suggested it to them. In my view this is all bog-standard planning for anyone who takes professional advice.” Speaking to Sky News, Starmer said the chancellor “has very, very serious questions to answer”. The Labour leader said Sunak had repeatedly raised taxes. “He says all of this is necessary, there’s no option. If it now transpires that his wife has been using schemes to reduce her own tax, then I’m afraid that is breathtaking hypocrisy. “We need complete transparency on this, so that we can all understand what schemes she may have been using to reduce her own tax.” Earlier the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, insisted the chancellor and his wife had been “incredibly transparent” about the arrangement. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “She’s an Indian citizen. And so she, as you say, pays tax here on UK income, but pays tax abroad on foreign income.” But asked where she paid tax abroad – in India or elsewhere such as the Cayman Islands – Kwarteng said: “I don’t know anything about her tax affairs.” Kwarteng added that Murty and Sunak had been “very transparent” about her status, and that Sunak had declared it when he became a minister. “The Treasury, the department which he works in, knows about all those affairs,” he said. “And there is a measure of transparency and he’s been very honest about that. And I think, as far as I’m concerned, that’s good enough for me. And I think we should move on from that story.” Earlier, Kwarteng had told Times Radio that non-domicile status had existed in the UK “for more than 200 years”. He said: “That’s something that’s been well established … I think there’s a lot of malicious attacks on someone who, after all, is a private citizen and is not a politician.”"
County Championship day one: Surrey make solid start – as it happened,2022-04-07T08:58:57Z,Tanya Aldred at Edgbaston,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7m7h,"I don’t know if the CC-Live bar is now empty, but huge congratulations to Essex pair Alastair Cook and Nick Browne, and commiserations to Kent for the spectator sport. An entertaining first day all round, despite the weather, with a particular hey-ho in the wind and the rain to young Sussex. I’m off to wriggle my cramped fingers - see you back here tomorrow. Thanks for all the messages. Good night! Ollie Pope in fine fettle, 27 not out at a run a ball. Four fours off one Brookes over. Surrey 148-3 I’d better write up for the paper, so leave you with the Chelmsford race to 100 (Cook 93, Browne 96); Hampshire rattling along (34-0) after bowling Somerset out for 180 and Gloucstershire struggling (103-6). In Division Two, Sussex stride onwards (240-5, Clark 57 not out); while White and Holden rebuild for revitalised Middlesex (247-3). Glamorgan 164-4 (Ingram 71; Cooke 30) v Durham. It was the hail wot did it. “Hi Tanya, You put Lord’s in NW6 in your comments on Eskinazi” writes Michael Billington. The Michael Billington. “It’s actually in NW8.Enjoy a great summer!” Gah! Always getting my NWs in a muddle, thank you! There are shadows, real shadows, encroaching on the Edgbaston pitch. An elongated lighting pylon throws shade across the slips. Amla, bat semi-aloft, is bowled! Whatever that ball from Hannon-Dalby did took him completely by surprise. Surrey 126-3. Here we go again: sun out, Amla and Pope both on O. Play will restart at 4.50 here at Edgbaston, with 29.5 overs remaining.The sun is out, the tractors circle, and the spectators have either given up or are hiding inside. Tom Clark (20 yrs old) and Dan Ibrahim (17 yrs old)have put on 40 for the fifth wicket at Hove. Sussex 212-4 (Patterson-White 3-56) It seems Pollock didn’t last much longer. Bowled by Chris Wright for five. In fact, Worcestershire have stumbled to 15-2 as Azhar Ali is run-out for two on his club debut. Ah, I missed this. A lunchtime tribute to ex-Hampshire captain at the Rose Bowl today. Spectators were invited onto the pitch to watch a video, with a minute’s applause afterwards. Warne played for Hampshire in 2000 before returning to captain the club from 2004-2007, scoring his only two first-class centuries for the club, and taking 276 First-Class wickets at 25.58 One of the Five Wisden Cricketer’s of the twentieth century. Might make the 21st century bench too. A superstar. Just spotted that Worcestershire are opening the batting with a young debutant, Ed Pollock, alongside Jake Libby. Pollock was a junior at New Road before moving to Edgbaston. He is the first Warwicks player to hop along to New Road since Moeen Ali in 2007. He’s currently five not out, with a nerve-settling boundary under the belt. At Grace Road, the first ball of the day is about to be bowled at ten past four in the afternoon. De Caires, alas, cut short just 20 short of a maiden ton by Conners. Somerset are all out for 180 after winning the toss and batting. Not the world’s biggest surprise. Little to shout about apart from Hildreth’s 87 and a boundary-heavy 28 by van der Merwe. They’ll be very grateful for those 14 Hampshire extras. Now, what can Siddle do with the new ball? Meanwhile in Cardiff: “It’s great that the season is going again, and even greater that its all on youtube,” writes Andrew Benton. “Not so great is that Glos are now 45-4. At least things can only get better for them....hopefully.” Yes, a tricky start for new captain Graeme van Buuren. Here at Edgbaston, the umpires have trudged on, and trudged off again. Ah, and here come more covers. Such is April. “Good Afternoon Tanya, afternoon everyone listening especially Glos. and Durham supporters.” Hello Em Jackson! “I may be an outlier here, but the rain today surely gives us good reason to take Round 1 of the County Championship abroad - not saying to the UAE or Bahrain or anything “overly distant” but certainly Spain and Portugal perhaps? Either that or play The Hundred now . . . . after all, 100 balls in this weather won’t take long at all.” I’m not sure an early season trip abroad would be very popular with county members looking at their fixture list but your Hundred idea....it would even give the floodlights a chance to shine in the evenings... I like it! DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 153-0 v Kent Rose Bowl: Hampshire v Somerset 174-7. County Ground: Northants v Gloucestershire 66-4 Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Surrey 123-2 DIVISION TWO Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 153-4 v Durham Grace Road: Leicester v Worcestershire. No play, rain. Start due 4.10pm. Lord’s: Middlesex 205-2 v Derbyshire Hove: Sussex 189-4 v Nottinghamshire Gloucestershire’s top order having a brittle day at The County Ground. 57-4, with Bracey and Higgins hanging in there. Wishing Bracey a good year after the build-em-up/knock-em-down doldrums of 2021. Sanderson 2-10. Ignore me, I hadn’t refreshed the score from Lord’s. The first century of the season pennant has already been raised by Middlesex’s Stevie Eskinazi! Could the times be a-changing at NW6? It won’t be Hildreth who makes the first century of the season either, yorked by Liam Dawson for 87. Somerset 163-7. Four games are currently delayed by rain: Northants v Gloucestershire 36-3 Warwicks v Surrey 123-2 Glamorgan 153-4 v Durham Leicestershire v Worcestershire. No play yet today, wet outfield. The wind at Edgbaston is frankly unpleasant. No problems for Chris Cooke at Sophia Gardens though, currently 29 not out in a rain-ravaged day. Lloyd, Salter, Northeast (on debut, for 24) and Carlson (tipped by me and out for 1) all back in the dressing-room. Glamorgan 153-4. No game for them at Colwyn Bay incidentally this year. They’re off again here at Edgbaston. Sussex (164-3) defying all expectations, despite losing Haines, Alsop and Carter in fairly quick succession. Stuart Broad is due to join injury hit Notts for the second game. With rain still on the tip of everyone’s tongue, the players resume the field at Edgbaston. Hashim Amla 0 not out as he prepares for his first knock of the year. Who could forget last season’s stonewalling effort - 37 not out off 278 deliveries to ensure a draw for Surrey against Hampshire. For now, he stands at the non-striker’s end, hand on hip, jumper sleeves pulled tight to the wrist and OH! There goes Ryan Patel, who will not now be making the first century of the season after having a swing at Hannon-Dalby and being caught behind. Surrey 117-2. So, while the showers come and go, and Essex and Sussex and Middlesex laugh in the face of the doomsayers, tell me your players to watch for 2022. Round and round and round go the tractors with the rope. Meanwhile the sky over the Birmingham skyscrapers darkens once again.. An email flies in from a windswept Chelmsford, where Essex are 120-0. “Should pick the England side from the first players to reach a landmark,” writes Kroome. “Ryan Patel &amp; Nick Browne opening. Alastair Cook close to batting 3, need some bowlers now. Couldn’t be any worse?” It would be particularly helpful if we could “borrow” Abbas too. A maiden half-century for Josh De Caires, or Mike Atherton’s son, as I’m sure he doesn’t want to be known. Middlesex 145-1, up, up and away! Play will resume at Edgbaston at 3pm, if no further rain. Hail at Sophia Gardens has put back the prospects of play there a little longer. Meanwhile James Hildreth has skipped to the 126th fifty of his first-class career - he averaged a mere 22 last year. Early days for a ball of the season - but nominating this for the September awards: The wind causing Warwickshire’s groundsmen all sorts of issues, taking off like kites at Box Hill. Brilliant sunshine, but they must be expecting something. Settled in for the rain? Good - here is something excellent to read on Durham: They’re unrolling the green silky strings of the Warwickshire covers, and nailing them down with tent hooks. This doesn’t look good. Another fifty, this time for Nick Browne. Did these batters not read the memo for April 7? Asks Gareth Wilson: I remember him best for taking 6-5 in 23 balls against Somerset at Guildford to catalyse Surrey’s Championship-winning season, but I think he thinks of himself as a batting allrounder. Belt and braces covers at Edgbaston after a lunchtime squall, and another rain delay at The County Ground, and a further inspection at Grace Road at 1.50pm. At the Rose Bowl, James Hildreth (40 not out) is injecting some backbone into Somerset, while Steve Eskinazi (Middx) and Tom Haines (Sussex) charge on past fifty. Rory Burns gives Danny Briggs a return catch and that’s lunch! Time for a quick stroll and some sustenance - back shortly. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 86-0 v Kent Rose Bowl: Hampshire v Somerset 61-5. County Ground: Northants v Gloucestershire 10-2 Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Surrey 117-1 DIVISION TWO Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 110-4 v Durham Grace Road: Leicester v Worcestershire. No play, rain. Start due 1.10pm. Lord’s: Middlesex 96-1 v Derbyshire Hove: Sussex 101-0 v Nottinghamshire With ten minutes left till lunch, I’m giving the first session of the season to the batters. Nine wickets a relatively meagre haul for the counties bowlers. (with apologies to Hampshire, who have Somerset 52-4) “Hello Tanya.” Hello Simon McMahon! “As well as the first day of the English county season, it also happens to be my 25th wedding anniversary today, and what better way to celebrate than by visiting Lord’s with Mrs McMahon. Thanks for everything Mrs McMahon. I don’t know what I’d do without you. Anyway, to the cricket. Middlesex 56-1 after the first hour at a cold, blustery Lord’s. De Caires and Eskinazi looking well set after Stoneman chipped to mid wicket early on.” Thank you Simon and happy anniversary to you both. Good areas, as they say. Burns lives to fight for another lunchtime after skying Miles into the gloom, but just out of reach of the diving fielder. Somerset, as night follows day, are three down. The good news is that Hildreth, who had a season to forget last year, is into double figures (21). Choosing to face Hampshire’s attack on an April morning was certainly bold. Play will start at 1.10pm after mopping up activities are finished. Durham fans, this is for you: Rory Burns is now joining in the boundary game: plink, plonk, very much like flip the frog. Patel has a huge swing at Miles and misses. Surrey 97-0 and doing Eoin Morgan’s “no fear” thing. Each county is live streaming home games via its website or social media channels. You can also access all streams via the ECB website and commentary is available through BBC local radio. Nottinghamshire have tried four bowlers this morning - all without luck. Young Haines has rattled along to 44. SirAlastair, on the other hand, is in sedate mood at Chelmsford: 16 runs off 51 balls - three of them in boundaries. Here, Surrey skip through the Birmingham daisies - Patel (61 not out off 68) on course for the first hundred of the season. An hour in, how are things looking? Division One: Essex 39-0 v Kent; Somerset 21-2 v Hants; Gloucestershire 2-1 v Northants (late start, wicket with the 12th ball of the day); Surrey 61-0. Division Two: Glamorgan 52-1 vDurham; Leicestershire v Worcestershire start delayed by rain; Middlesex 52-1 v Derbys; Sussex 49-0 v Notts. Kudos to Sussex’s young blades in particular (Orr and Haines). As mentioned BTL, after bleeding players in the off season, the average age of Sussex’s squad for this game was 21.6. Ryan Patel reaches the first fifty of the season with his second six of the morning. Before noon as well, totally without decorum. Surrey 57-0, with a strut a last. Make that Somerset 19-2: Abell nudging Abbott to third slip. Somerset already down on their luck, beset by injuries: Tom Banton (broken finger), Sonny Baker (back), Lewis Gregory (illness), Josh Davey (groin operation). Jack Leach and Craig Overton are also both unavailable. The sun suddenly flashes over Edgbaston like a waft of a lantern. Rory Burns is still cautiously watching the ball over his right shoulder, while Ryan Patel has sped to 40. Surrey 47-0. Oh Somerset, why oh why, oh why? Mohammad Abbas doing Mohammad Abbas things: Ben Green caught at second slip ( Somerset, 19-1). Good morning Gary Naylor! The first wickets to fall come at Cardiff, where Glamorgan’s Andrew Salter has his stumps rearranged by Matthew Potts (23-1,) and Lord’s, where Mark Stoneman begins his season being caught at short midwicket off Shan Masood for 12. Tim has asked me to share this petition, on the future of County Cricket. The ECB’s high-performance review team, which hasn’t actually met yet and doesn’t seem to have a full quota of members, is being asked to come forward with a way to make the English Test team the best in the world and for an improved pathway between the county game and Test cricket. The counties would have to approve any changes (12-6) before next season. First packet of Bourbons opened and consumed. Slow and careful appreciation of the bowling here at Edgbaston (7-0). Both Warwicks and Somerset have so far survived their foolhardy bold decision to bat first. At the County Ground and Grace Road. Hannon-Dalby has the new ball, Rory Burns to face. Liam Norwell has a back spasm after spending nights scrunched up on hospital chairs following the birth of his baby. Surrey and Warwickshire line up next to the Championship trophy. The players trousers are going like the clappers in the glacial wind. We have a moment of unity which also remembers those lost in the off season. I can currently count 78 people in the stands, but there may be more that I can’t spot Something for you to get stuck into: And I forgot to say, do get in touch either via email tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com, twitter @tjaldred or BTL. I’m really hoping this is another belter of a season for Stevens. After the last few years it would be awful to bow out with a whimper. Not that I’m saying he’s bowing out... DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Kent win and will field Rose Bowl: Somerset win and will bat (ARGHGHGGH) County Ground: Northants win and will field Edgbaston: Surrey win and will bat DIVISION TWO Sophia Gardens: Durham win and will field Grace Road: Worcestershire win and will bat Lord’s: Derbyshire win and will field Hove: Nottinghamshire win and will field There’s a bitter, bitter wind blowing across Edgbaston and the players are warming up in woolly hats and long johns. I think I can see at least one pair of gloves, though I’ve forgotten my binoculars so that may not be a hundred per cent accurate. You’ll be glad to know that the coffee machine in the press lounge is in good working order. Rory Burns is waiting in the middle for the toss, his hands firmly in his pockets, hair in a Gareth Bale top knot. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex v Kent Rose Bowl: Hampshire v Somerset County Ground: Northants v Gloucestershire Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Surrey DIVISION TWO Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan v Durham Grace Road: Leicester v Worcestershire Lord’s: Middlesex v Derbyshire Hove: Sussex v Nottinghamshire Good morning! It’s lovely to be back. Welcome to another summer of careers waking and sighing, inexplicable collapses and Darren Stevens . The County Blog lives to fight another season thanks to so many of you who click on to read, and post B(elow) T(he) L(ine). If you’re a regular, thank you for coming back. If you’re new, hello! Please stick around - espresso and custard tarts available just before 11. It’s a murky scene out of the train window as the cross-country trundles past Macclesfield, but there’s a reason that the most northerly games this round are in the midlands, and the forecast is brisk but dry around most of the grounds. A quick resume: the Championship returns to two divisions as decided by the 2019 season, with ten in Division One, eight in Division Two. Nottinghamshire have pulled the shortest straw, languishing in the bottom division despite finally finding their form somewhere behind the laundry basket last summer. Covid regulations have largely disappeared, though those who test positive will have to withdraw from games. Two regulations that come into cricket law in October will be used in the Championship this season: no saliva on the ball, and the new batter to take strike no matter whether the previous batters crossed while a catch was being taken. Points wise: 16 for a win, eight for a tie or a draw (encouragement for counties not to gamble on result pitches.). First innings batting and bowling points in the first 110 overs work like this: Batting Points: 200 to 249 runs - 1 point, 250 to 299 runs - 2 points, 300 to 349 runs - 3 points, 350 to 399 runs - 4 points, 400 runs or over - 5 points. Bowling Points: 3 to 5 wickets taken - 1 point, 6 to 8 wickets taken - 2 points, 9 to 10 wickets taken - 3 points. I’m heading to Edgbaston, where Champions Warwickshire start the season with a visit from Surrey - who can’t have another under-performing season, can they? Plenty to keep an eye on , with Rory Burns’s team of England nearly men, including Ollie Pope and Sam Curran, complemented by Hashim Amla and Kemar Roach. Dom Sibley returns for Warwicks after a winter of rebuilding work - Mark Robinson compared him to an overseas player in terms of his contribution. Elsewhere: Essex and Kent meet at Chelmsford for an (on paper) one-sided affair (Zak Crawley is rested), Somerset have to face Mohammad Abbas and Kyle Abbot at the Ageas Bowl, while Northants and Gloucestershire contest the battle of the newly(ish) promoted. In Division Two, Derbyshire’s Shan Masood avoids meeting his compatriot Shaheen Shah Afridi, yet to land at Middlesex, fresh-faced Sussex take on raging Nottinghamshire, Glamorgan and Durham meet at Cardiff, Worcestershire and Leicestershire at Grace Road. Yorkshire and Lancashire, meanwhile, skip the first round. Lancashire have announced a surplus of £1.8m for 2021 , while all eyes are on Yorkshire, in emergency recovery mode. They just announced a new sponsor, Indian streaming platform Clean Slate, after losing 43 sponsors in the fall out from the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal. “There’s a long journey to go,” Lord Patel told the BBC - “governance reform, culture change, listening to people, mindset changing.” Yorkshire await to hear whether they will be docked points by the ECB’s independent commission. Some other overseas names to look out for, though not all will start today: Hasan Ali (Lancashire), Naseem Shah, Zafar Gohar, Marcus Harris (Gloucestershire), Haris Rauf (Yorkshire), Shan Masood (Derby), Azhar Ali (Worcestershire), Mohammad Rizwan and Cheteshwar Pujara (Sussex), Marnus Labuschagne and Michael Neser (Glamorgan). The teams must throw themselves into the season without knowing how the cards will fall at the end, with a reorganisation likely for 2023, depending on the findings of the High Performance Review sparked by the Test team’s calamitous winter. Is this a referendum on the county game? I’ll leave Mark Robinson to answer that. “Whatever county cricket does it can’t win, can it? I think the game of cricket just needs some good news stories.”"
County Championship: Essex’s Cook and Browne ruffle Kent on opening day,2022-04-07T18:34:53Z,Tanya Aldred at Edgbaston,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pfp,"If the County Championship season started with its traditional squelch, a surprising number of batters were able to see off April’s demons. At Edgbaston, where the wind snapped across the ground like a bad-tempered terrier, terrorising the glove-wearing umpire and billowing the covers, Surrey made steady progress against the reigning county champions, Warwickshire, despite the frequent weather interruptions. Ryan Patel, opening the innings, galloped along to 75 before having a wild swing at Olly Hannon-Dalby, while Ashes flotsam Rory Burns chugged along to a steady 41 in an opening partnership of 117. Hashim Amla was also misled by Hannon-Dalby, stumps-a-splatter for two, and Ollie Pope caressed a quick 40 before stumps. At Chelmsford, old hands Alastair Cook and Nick Browne made the most of a friendly pitch, putting on 220 for the first wicket and each reaching a century as Kent’s bowlers toiled into the swirling gale. Australian Jackson Bird, on debut, dismissed them both in fairly quick succession before Dan Lawrence shouldered arms to a ball that nipped back. Stevie Eskinazi made the first Championship hundred of the year, and his first at Lord’s in five years, in a classy innings of 118 as Middlesex ambled along confidently against a wan and depleted Derbyshire attack. Josh de Caires, Michael Atherton’s 19-year-old son, collected his maiden first-class 50 in an innings of careful cribbage. Derbyshire’s cause was not helped when Ryan Sidebottom, their new signing, limped off the field after 1.1 overs with a suspected hamstring problem. At Hove, Sussex’s rosy-cheeked apple scrumpers, with an average age only just over 21, made sublime progress against big boys Nottinghamshire. Fifties for Ali Orr and Tom Haines, the captain, and 82 not out from Tom Clark frustrated a bowling attack hobbled by injury. Liam Patterson-White, who bowled unchanged for 30 overs from the sea end, the breeze kissing his left shoulder, was the pick with three for 69. Apocalyptic hail thwarted progress at Cardiff, where 71 from Colin Ingram kept Glamorgan steady against Durham. Chris Rushworth trapped an enterprising Sam Northeast lbw on his club debut for 24. There were, though, some batting sides who hadn’t read the memo. Somerset were bowled out for 180 after electing to bat against Mohammad Abbas and co, with only James Hildreth passing 30. Hildreth, in the last year of his contract, played sweetly for 87. Hampshire were 109 without loss at stumps. Ben Sanderson took four for 38 to put Northamptonshire on top in the battle of the promotion class of 2019. Only James Bracey, 77 not out, seriously disturbed the scoreboard as Gloucestershire finished 164 for eight. And Worcestershire’s in-out day against Leicestershire was spoiled by Chris Wright’s three for 33, with Azhar Ali run out for two on his club debut."
Hedwig and the Angry Inch review – Divina De Campo brings drag queen swagger to grunge musical,2022-04-07T18:33:45Z,Mark Fisher,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pez,"John Cameron Mitchell’s grunge musical is the strangest of shows. It combines the kind of high-camp monologue you’d expect at a cabaret club – all knowing narcissism and arch innuendo – with a set of authentically scuzzy rock songs that recall the sounds of a 90s basement dive. Neither has much to do with the other. Dating from 1998, the show prefigures the gig-theatre wave of the last decade and yet exists in its own self-referential universe, too sketchy for narrative engagement, too meandering for emotional impact. In 2022, some aspects seem stranger still. Maybe we can accept Hedwig’s origins in communist East Berlin, but the jokes about Manhattan districts and US middle-of-the-road bands are from another place and time. And yet this high-class production by Jamie Fletcher shows it is in keeping with our gender-fluid age. When Divina De Campo makes her look-at-me entrance as Hedwig from the back of the theatre, milking the audience for applause, she is dressed in a stars-and-stripes cape that opens up to reveal the slogan “gender is a construct”. It’s safe to say that she and her excellent four-piece band, plus Elijah Ferreira as husband, Yitzhak, are happily unconstructed. Hedwig presents herself as the missing link between east and west, top and bottom, male and female, an antidote to binary divisions, as she makes her way from Europe to the US, Lotte Lenya accent intact. De Campo has more than just drag queen swagger; she matches her stage presence with an effortless vocal range, bringing resonance and subtlety to Stephen Trask’s songs. Those songs are an amalgam of rock, funk, boogie-woogie and punk, showing the influences of everyone from Iggy Pop to REM, and expertly performed under the musical direction of Alex Beetschen. Accompanied by Daniel Denton’s colourful video designs, they are the pulsing bedrock of the show. For all the talent on display, the show’s appeal passes me by today as much as it did on its original run in New York. Don’t take my word for it – the audience laps it up with gusto – but I can’t think of a show that leaves me so unsure of the joke or so puzzled about what it is trying to say. • Hedwig and the Angry Inch is at Leeds Playhouse until 23 April."
UK to announce fresh military aid package for Ukraine,2022-04-07T18:33:18Z,Dan Sabbagh Defence and security correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7phm,"Britain is preparing to announce a fresh package of military aid for Ukraine and has demonstrated new missile systems and armoured vehicles that it believes can help Kyiv in the next phases of fighting. Junior defence ministers Jeremy Quin and James Heappey invited Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Volodymyr Havrylov to Salisbury Plain on Wednesday, where they discussed what extra weapons the UK could supply. “It was an honour to show Minister Havrylov and his generals the kit the UK hopes to provide next and to discuss some new weapons that have been trialled recently with UK forces,” Heappey said. The army and Royal Marines demonstrated a range of equipment and “options for further military support”, which, the Ministry of Defence said, included “defensive missile systems and protected mobility vehicles”. The protected mobility vehicle is thought to refer to the Mastiff, a heavily armoured patrol vehicle, first deployed in Afghanistan, which would help Ukraine’s forces achieve greater manoeuvrability against Russian attacks in the eastern Donbas. It is less certain what artillery could be provided, although there has been speculation that the UK could offer the AS-90 howitzer, which has a range of nearly 15 miles and would help Ukraine’s forces contend with Russian shelling. Either would be a modest step up from the 4,200-plus NLAW anti-tank bazookas and the Starstreak anti-aircraft systems the UK has already sent to Ukraine, described by the UK as “defensive weaponry” designed to prevent the Russians from swiftly conquering the country. One source said that Downing Street was likely to make an announcement on the next steps for military aid before the end of the week. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, met Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday afternoon, where the issue was discussed. “Both leaders agreed that the west needed to accelerate its support to Ukraine in the coming days and go further and faster with the equipment it was supplying,” said Downing Street after the meeting. Western countries have begun pledging a fresh wave of military aid after Russia’s initial attack on Kyiv was repulsed, recognising that the conflict had moved to a new phase in which Ukraine is trying to prevent Moscow’s forces advancing in the east and holding on to gains made in the south of the country. A donor conference convened by the UK and attended by more than 35 countries last week hammered out what each state was willing to supply. At the time, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said that the best counter to Russia’s artillery was “other long-range artillery”. Some countries have already announced their plans. The US has committed $400m (£300m) of aid in the past week, including the APKWS rockets that can be used from air and land, and 10 Switchblade 600 drones that employ the same missiles used by the Javelin anti-tank weapon. The Czech Republic has committed tens of T-72 Soviet-designed tanks – the first time a Nato country has agreed to such send heavy armour to Ukraine. But it is still only a modest contribution to Kyiv’s war effort."
Fears genocidal language in Russian media may prompt more war crimes,2022-04-07T18:30:41Z,Andrew Roth Moscow correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zpg,"Two days after Russia began its war in Ukraine, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency accidentally published an article celebrating the country’s lightning-quick victory over Kyiv, crowing that the “period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end”. After a bloody month of war, after the discovery of evidence of war crimes in cities like Bucha and Borodyanka, the language in that same publication has grown even more extreme, containing calls for societal purges and “re-education” that western officials said could provoke further abuses on the ground. “Ukrainianism is an artificial anti-Russian construct that has no civilisational substance of its own, a subordinate element of an extraneous and alien civilisation,” wrote a RIA Novosti columnist earlier this week. The “re-education” of Ukraine could take a generation, he wrote, adding that “besides the highest ranks, a significant number of common people are also guilty of being passive Nazis and Nazi accomplices”. Even the name Ukraine must be erased, the article argued. Views that were once kept to fringe publications in Russia have gone into mainstream outlets and been voiced on primetime TV as the stakes of Russia’s war in Ukraine have risen. Western observers from Ukraine to the United States have grown worried that the language may be encouraging the abuse of civilians by soldiers on the ground. “This is another piece of evidence for a future tribunal against Russian war criminals,” said Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, citing the RIA Novosti article, which caused a major uproar among western officials. One of his aides accused the news agency of calling for the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians. Civilians in Ukraine have reported Russian soldiers citing conspiracy theories about bioweapon labs or telling them they were only here to “cleanse them from the dirt”. “Those sorts of comments are really creating an even more toxic information environment,” a western official said, and could “absolutely contribute” to abuse of civilians in Ukraine. “Responsibility for this, of course lies with the perpetrators of the acts, but it also lies with the Russian leadership,” the official added. Increasingly, Russia’s pundit class has pushed claims that a significant swath of Ukrainian society is under the sway of far-right ideologies, blaming Ukraine’s staunch resistance to the attack on mass psychosis rather than on legitimate anger at the Russian invasion. “To my horror, to my regret, a considerable portion of the Ukrainian people have turned out to be engulfed in the madness of nazism,” said Margarita Simonyan, the head of the RT news network, during a nationally broadcast talkshow on the NTV channel. “That it is on such a massive scale!” Analysts have pointed to the failure of Russia’s war in its early stages, as well as images of protests in cities against Russian occupying forces, for the escalation in Russian rhetoric. Initially Russians believed that “‘de-nazification’ could be completed through regime change and Ukrainians should be liberated,” wrote Greg Yudin, a Russian sociologist, earlier this week. “Obviously, this conception failed when Ukrainians started resisting bravely. A natural conclusion from that: Ukrainians turned out to be deeply infected by nazism.” As Vladimir Putin has called on his officials to push back against the west’s “information war”, claiming reports of atrocities in Bucha were staged, the government line has also grown closer to some of the most extreme opinions in the Russian news. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian prime minister, earlier this week declared that Ukraine would face the same fate as Nazi Germany, an opinion that closely resembled the one written in the column published by RIA Novosti just days earlier. “It should not be surprising that Ukraine, which has been transformed mentally into the Third Reich … will suffer the same fate,” Medvedev wrote in a message shared on Telegram. “That’s what her fate is, that Ukraine!”"
Ban for former Paralympian whose charity paid £1m to family companies,2022-04-07T18:26:12Z,Patrick Butler Social policy editor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pcd,"A former medal-winning Paralympian footballer has been banned from being a trustee by the charities watchdog after an investigation found a disability sports charity he founded paid £1m raised by the public to companies run by him and his wife. The Charity Commission said Matt Dimbylow, 51, who represented the GB seven-a-side football team in the 2008 and 2012 Paralympics, and was a Paralympic World Cup medal-winner, was guilty of serious misconduct and abusing public trust. Of £6m raised for the charity Dream It Believe It Achieve It (DIBIAI) through a lottery scratchcard scheme, £1m was paid to companies run by Dimbylow and his wife, Emma Dimbylow, the commission found. A further £4.2m went on fundraising costs, including payments to an unnamed private lottery operator. Just £300,000 was spent on charitable purposes. “The public expects trustees to ensure charitable funds are always carefully managed in the best interests of their charity and the cause they serve, in this case supporting children and disabled people with sport. Instead, the Dimbylows abused the trust that was placed in them as trustees,” said the Charity Commission’s head of investigations, Amy Spiller. The commission concluded there had been significant breaches of trust at the charity, while its failure to tackle conflicts of interest had led to the pair enjoying “substantial unauthorised financial benefit” that was not in the charity’s best interests. Dimbylow – described as the “driving force” at the DIBIAI – was banned permanently from being a trustee, while Emma Dimbylow signed an agreement promising not to act as a trustee again. The charity is in the process of being wound up, and any remaining funds will be given to another disability sports charity. Matt Dimbylow became involved in the Paralympian game after a head injury in 2003 triggered a Parkinson’s-like brain condition. He also captained the England cerebral palsy football team and was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame alongside Alan Shearer, Michael Owen and Patrick Vieira in 2013. He registered the charity the same year, and the commission concluded he planned to “extract funds from it”. It said it stepped in early on to prevent him, as a trustee, from paying himself an £80,000 salary. He subsequently amended the charity’s governing document to enable it to pay companies owned by himself and his wife. The commission began formally investigating the charity in 2017, and Matt Dimbylow was removed as a trustee two years later. Some of the funds paid by the charity to the Dimbylows’ companies were subsequently recovered by the commission through the courts. While the inquiry was ongoing, the commission said it took action to restrict more than 30 bank accounts held in the charity’s name to stop payments being made without the regulator’s approval. Although the charity fundraising regulator looked into the actions of the lottery operator, no action was taken. The watchdog criticised two other unnamed trustees of the charity, who it said were insufficiently independent and failed to hold the Dimbylows to account for their actions. “Their lack of oversight and scrutiny created an environment where the charity’s funds could be misapplied,” the commission concluded. The commission said it hoped its regulatory action against DIBIAI “sends a powerful message to others who may be tempted to use charity in this way”. Matt Dimbylow and DIBIAI were approached for comment."
Police raid office in Unite union’s HQ in fraud investigation,2022-04-07T18:24:42Z,Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pc3,"Police have raided an office in the headquarters of one of the UK’s biggest unions as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery, money laundering and fraud. More than 20 officers from South Wales police arrived unannounced on Wednesday at the offices of Unite in Holborn, central London. Police took away a number of items including documentation, notebooks and a computer. The raid was part of a joint inquiry by the south Wales force and HM Revenue and Customs. Officers also executed warrants in the South Wales, Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales, Dyfed-Powys and Northamptonshire police areas. A Unite spokesperson said: “A Unite employee is subject to a criminal investigation by the police. On Wednesday 6 April the employee’s office at Unite HQ, in Holborn London, was accessed and searched by the police under warrant.” Unite was Labour’s most generous donor under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the party. In December its new general secretary, Sharon Graham, said she planned to cut donations to Labour and divert the money to union campaigns. Graham, who was elected in August, has launched an inquiry into how the building costs of a hotel and conference centre in Birmingham spiralled into a “potentially significant loss” for the union. The initial projected cost for the 170-room complex was £57m, but the cost soared to £98m, an increase Unite said was a result of safeguarding employment practices onsite. A police spokesperson said: “South Wales police has executed warrants as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery, fraud and money laundering. The warrants were executed on Wednesday 6 April at addresses in the South Wales, Metropolitan, Merseyside, Cheshire, north Wales, Dyfed Powys and Northamptonshire police force areas. “The joint investigation with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is continuing and a number of suspects will be interviewed in due course.”"
Customs IT meltdown adds to long delays at Channel crossings,2022-04-07T18:18:48Z,Joanna Partridge,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pxf,"UK customs officials are battling to resolve an outage in a key post-Brexit IT system, with drivers complaining that the malfunction is adding to long delays for freight traffic trying to cross the Channel. A surge in Easter tourist traffic and reduced sailings from Dover, where several P&amp;O ferries are still out of commission after the mass sacking of crew members, are combining with delays at customs to create havoc on the roads into the port, with parts of the coastbound M20 motorway in Kent turned into a temporary lorry park as HGVs wait to reach France. Haulage industry insiders have put part of the blame for the gridlock on the week-long outage of one of the government’s new trade portals, the goods vehicle movement service (GVMS). It first experienced problems on 30 March and has not been available for use by traders and hauliers since the following day. Drivers are being warned it may not be up and running until Monday. GVMS, which was developed by and is the responsibility of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), has been suffering a systems outage since it was temporarily taken offline during an update to another government customs system, handling import and export freight, known as Chief. Ciaran Donovan, a driver based in the UK who regularly moves goods back and forth between Britain and the continent, said he was unable to use the GVMS portal to get the goods movement reference (GMR) number – a barcode – required to leave the UK last Wednesday. “I had to cancel a job out to Paris on Thursday, which was annoying,” he said. GVMS users trying to access the service have been notified on at least two occasions over the past week that the system would soon be operational again. However, those dates have come and gone and the government has said GVMS will not be up and running again until midday on Monday. Traders trying to access GVMS are notified that HMRC is “still investigating ongoing issues” with the service. In the meantime, HMRC has implemented contingency measures, allowing hauliers to show other evidence that a customs declaration has been made to take goods out of or bring them into the UK, including a transit accompanying document or a movement reference number. Despite these interim measures, truckers say the requirement to provide different customs information is likely to add to processing time at the border. The GMR barcode is scannable and thought to save time. An HMRC spokesperson said: “Our IT systems are stable: we have put in place contingency processes to ensure businesses can keep goods and freight moving while we return to full service.” They apologised for any inconvenience and said they would work closely with customers to avoid disruption, adding that HMRC took “system resilience very seriously”. Donovan said current disruption meant he was working out whether to accept future courier jobs. “I would rather not work than sit there for 20 hours trying to leave the country,” he said. Duncan Buchanan, the policy director at the Road Haulage Association, described the week-long outage to GVMS as “really unhelpful” at a time of an “accumulation” of other problems. The vessels usually operated by P&amp;O Ferries are still out of action after the company’s mass sacking of 800 workers last month, representing a third of Dover’s usual ferry capacity. Bad weather has also delayed some sailings in recent days, just as tourist traffic booms before the Easter holidays, and the traffic backlog was further increased by the breakdown of a Eurotunnel train on Monday. Drivers faced another day of traffic chaos on Thursday as lorries queued for hours to reach Dover port and the Eurotunnel terminal, and Kent residents faced disruption and diversions. A 23-mile stretch of the M20 from junction eight near Maidstone to junction 11 at Westenhanger was closed on Thursday to all non-freight traffic as part of the Operation Brock traffic management system. It was estimated that more than 2,000 lorries were stuck in the queue. “One member reported that they joined the queue at 8pm last night and this morning just before 9am they were still 30 miles from Dover,” said Buchanan, adding that lorry drivers were being forced to wait in their cabs without access to toilets or places to buy food and drink. “We are getting lots of feedback from drivers who are complaining about the absence of facilities. They are basically being advised to take their statutory rest before going to Kent,” he said. Days of traffic chaos have also affected Kent residents and businesses, said Toby Howe, the tactical lead at the Kent Resilience Forum, a partnership of agencies and organisations. “We basically have more lorries coming into the county than can get out the other end,” Howe said. “This issue isn’t going to go away, and it is always Kent and its residents who have to pay the price if there are any problems on the Channel crossings.” Trevor Bartlett, the leader of Dover district council, said in an open letter that the port would remain under severe pressure up to Easter, and he would not hesitate to “declare a major incident” if Dover was again snarled up by port traffic, because of local fears that this could hamper the emergency services."
Video appears to show Ukrainian soldiers shooting Russian prisoner of war,2022-04-07T18:12:43Z,Jenn Selby,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pnp,"Soldiers fighting for Ukraine appear to shoot a Russian prisoner of war outside a village west of Kyiv in a video posted online. The footage was originally shared on social media app Telegram. The New York Times said it had verified the video and the BBC said it had confirmed the location north of the town of Dmytrivka and found satellite images showing bodies on the ground. In the video, at least three men in camouflage, including one with a head wound and his hands tied behind his back, can be seen lying dead next to a fourth man, who is breathing heavily with a jacket covering his head. “He’s still alive. Film these marauders. Look, he’s still alive. He’s gasping,” a man in the video can be heard saying in Russian – a language widely spoken in Ukraine. A soldier then shoots him in the head twice. He continues to move, so the soldier shoots again, and he stops. A soldier can then be heard shouting “Glory to Ukraine”. A man responds with the phrase: “Glory to heroes.” The audio ends with a man saying: “Do not [expletive] come to our land.” The living soldiers in the video are wearing the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow on their arms, while the men on the floor wear white armbands, the colour of Russian troops. A few metres away from the bodies is a BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicle which is used by the Russian airborne unit. BBC investigators attempted to biometrically match the face of one of the men in the video, who can be seen facing the camera with a distinctive beard. They found a match to a Georgian man with close links to Ukraine, but are yet to confirm his identity. The broadcaster believes the word “Gruziny” – which means Georgians in Russian – can also be heard. Scenes in the video match the scenery on Google Street View of the main road outside Dmytrivka, which is about seven miles south-west of Bucha with roads to Irpin. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Thursday he was aware of the video and it would “definitely be investigated”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he had not seen the video, but stated: “I will say that every report on potential violations of international law should be followed or looked into, and of course, any violation of international law and any war crime is always unacceptable.” A war crime is defined by the United Nations as a serious breach of international law committed against civilians or enemy forces during an armed conflict. The video emerges days after the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Russian military of undertaking the worst war crimes since the second world war after the discovery of mass civilian graves in Bucha, a city 15 miles north of Kyiv."
Johnson’s political cowardice applies brake to cheap energy as he bets on nuclear,2022-04-07T18:08:10Z,Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zm5,"The two main criticisms of the government’s new energy security strategy are fair. The tiptoeing around onshore wind, which got gentle words of encouragement but no change to planning regulations, looks a case of political cowardice. It is perverse to apply a handbrake to “one of the cheapest forms of renewable power”, to use the government’s own description, when public opinion is broadly supportive of turbines on land. Objections from Tory backbenchers should have been ignored. Equally, the lack of new measures on energy efficiency is bizarre since every serious body, from the International Energy Agency to our own National Infrastructure Commission, has been banging the drum for ages. “A gradual transition following the grain of behaviour” translates as a win for the cold hand of the Treasury. There were two clear positives in the mix, it should be said. First, the target for more offshore wind is genuinely ambitious. A fivefold increase in capacity to 50 gigawatts by the end of the decade is a significant upgrade on the previous aim of 40GW. The target may even be achievable given the current rate of progress. And from the perspective of energy security – the focus of this policy, don’t forget – offshore’s bigger turbines and higher load factors are always going to score well versus onshore. Second, solar was given a boost with the aim (though not a target, note) to increase capacity fivefold by 2035. It is illogical that the government seems more willing to flex planning rules for solar than for wind, but solar is the quiet success story of the renewables revolution. It has outpaced every cost projection over the past decade. Expansion looks the easiest to deliver. Then, though, one comes to the meat of the plan. The big bet on nuclear is, to put it mildly, hopeful. The government is trying to replace current capacity that will largely go offline by 2050 and also double nuclear’s share of electricity supply versus today’s position. The plan strains credibility. Up to eight new reactors – call it four new two-reactor plants the size of Hinkley Point C – is an enormous undertaking. The best that can be said is that it is possible to imagine how events could, possibly, run favourably. Hinkley could arrive within its revised timetable without further cost hiccups. Sizewell C in Suffolk, the next plant on the block, could attract the desired rush of private-sector investors under a new financing model that would allow the juice to be priced within the £60-£70 a megawatt hour range of political acceptability. And success in financing Sizewell could breed confidence and get the show rolling. There are, though, a lot of assumptions in that list. The biggest unknown is whether the government is prepared to back the EPR design – the one used at Hinkley and set for Sizewell – for all the new plants. Logic says it should because mixing and matching designs is a recipe for higher costs and surprises, a point stressed by the energy analyst Peter Atherton. The productivity gain in constructing Hinkley’s second reactor, for example, is said to be 15%. In a complex process, replicating one design has demonstrable value. The government is not, though, at the stage where it can have sufficient confidence to back EPRs wholeheartedly and mean it. Talk of “leading the world” in nuclear construction should therefore be filed under “believe it when you see it”. You have to know what you plan to build to make such boasts. There is an alarming nuclear-sized question mark at the heart of this strategy. Shareholders push supermarkets towards living wage See, resolutions from agitating shareholders can make a difference. Well, the tale of two pay rises for frontline staff in the supermarket sector cannot be attributed directly to the resolution filed at Sainsbury’s by the campaign group Share Action with backing from Legal &amp; General among others. But it probably helped to concentrate minds in the boardroom. Tesco is raising its minimum hourly rate of pay by 5.8% to £10.10 from late-July. Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s is expected to lift the rate for staff in outer London from £10.50 an hour to £11.05, meaning those workers will join colleagues in the rest of the country in getting the real living wage at a minimum. The shareholder resolution called on Sainsbury’s (and, by extension, its main competitors) to get itself accredited as a real living wage employer, which would require it go further. The commitment has to be permanent and third-party contractors such as cleaners and security guards have to be included. But perhaps the pace is quickening. It should. Large supermarket chains should be able to meet accepted definitions of living wages."
‘Judge Jackson stands on the shoulders of giants’: women of color on a day to celebrate,2022-04-07T18:06:40Z,Maya Yang,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7jng,"Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the US supreme court has passed the Senate and she will now become the first Black female justice on America’s highest legal body after being nominated by Joe Biden earlier this year. Jackson’s nomination has been widely praised by women of color, especially after she sustained grueling confirmation hearings at the hands of some top Republicans who seemed dedicated to political points-scoring and whose criticisms often seemed like racist dog-whistling. Here are four women of color talking about Jackson and the significance of her nomination: Kamala Harris, US vice-president “I’ll tell you what I think you know. Judge Jackson is a phenomenal jurist,” Harris said last month in Selma, Alabama, during the 57th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday”. Jackson “proves her commitment not only to public service but to equal justice and equal rights”, Harris added. “As she makes history, Judge Jackson, like us all, stands on the shoulders of giants. She and we are their legacy.” Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center “The world demands untold levels of strength from Black women on a daily basis. The perseverance Jackson held close is all too familiar to Black women across this country,” Graves wrote in a CNN op-ed last month during Jackson’s confirmation hearings. “We hailed her career and celebrated not only her, but also the work of countless Black women silenced, erased and excluded from the top echelon of the legal profession,” she said, adding: “This will be the legacy of her rise to the supreme court: a young Black girl, one of a generation of Black girls, joyful at the sight of new possibilities for her own life.” Ann Claire Williams, retired US circuit judge of the US court of appeals for the 7th circuit In a statement on behalf of the American Bar Association’s standing committee on the federal judiciary, Williams wrote: “Judge Jackson has a sterling reputation for integrity. Judges and lawyers who have known her in every capacity uniformly praised her character, calling her integrity ‘beyond reproach’, ‘first rate’, and ‘impeccable’.” “Our extensive review leads us to conclude that Judge Jackson meets the highest standards of integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament,” Williams continued, granting Jackson the ABA’s highest rating. Angela Onwuachi-Willig, dean of Boston University School of Law “We don’t only get judged by our actions as individuals, all Black people get judged by our actions,” Onwuachi-Willig said in reference to Jackson’s confirmation hearings. “That’s an enormous weight. Judge Jackson was carrying that weight for hours and hours and hours, and I felt that was a human moment.” “With nearly 10 years of service as a federal judge, experience clerking for Supreme court justice Stephen Breyer and two lower-court judges, and a record of leadership on the United States Sentencing Commission, she will make an incredible supreme court justice,” Onwuachi-Willig also said in a letter, along with more than 200 other Black women law deans and professors, that urged the Senate’s confirmation of Jackson."
Republicans’ ugly attacks on Ketanji Brown Jackson show lurch to far right,2022-04-07T18:05:19Z,Joan E Greve in Washington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7yhp,"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson reached a historic milestone on Thursday, becoming the first Black woman ever appointed to the US supreme court. But before Jackson could be confirmed, she first had to navigate a brutal opposition campaign from far-right critics who challenged her credentials and outlandishly accused her of supporting child abuse. The bareknuckle tactics used by some Republicans to discredit Jackson underscored just how far to the right the party has drifted and may foreshadow a new, disturbing “normal” for American politics. The Republican senator Roger Wicker offered a preview of the ugly attacks to come when he said in late January, before Jackson was even nominated, that Joe Biden’s appointee would be the beneficiary of affirmative action because the president had already promised to select a Black woman for the post. That comment sparked outrage among Democrats, who noted Biden would have a wealth of qualified candidates to choose from to fill Stephen Breyer’s seat. After Jackson’s nomination was announced in February, Tucker Carlson, the far-right Fox News host, took it a step further by demanding that the White House release her score on the LSAT, a standardized test for law school applicants. “So is Ketanji Brown Jackson – a name that even Joe Biden has trouble pronouncing – one of the top legal minds in the entire country?” Carlson asked. “[I]t might be time for Joe Biden to let us know what Ketanji Brown Jackson’s LSAT score was … It would seem like Americans in a democracy have a right to know.” Carlson’s complaint seemed to ignore that Jackson is considered one of the most qualified supreme court nominees in recent history. She has served as a supreme court clerk, a public defender, a district court judge, a member of the US Sentencing Commission and a federal appeals judge. Carlson’s mockery of Jackson’s first name, which is pronounced “kee-TON-jee,” also struck critics as a racist dog-whistle. But worse was to come. The beginning of Jackson’s confirmation hearings last month spurred a new, alarming line of attack from certain Republicans. In a Twitter thread shared days before the start of the hearings, Josh Hawley, a member of the Senate judiciary committee, claimed Jackson had a “pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook for their appalling crimes”. Hawley’s claims were quickly debunked by factcheckers and even conservative legal experts, who showed that Jackson’s sentencing practices for child abuse image offenders were in the mainstream for federal judges. One White House official dismissed Hawley’s claims as an “embarrassing, QAnon-signaling smear”, referring to the baseless conspiracy theory that Democratic leaders are members of an evil cabal involved in child sex trafficking. The left-leaning organization Media Matters reported that Hawley’s comments quickly spread on internet forums linked to QAnon. But instead of abandoning the accusation when it was proved to be demonstrably false and potentially dangerous, more Republican senators joined Hawley in grilling Jackson about her handling of child abuse cases. Lindsey Graham, who voted to confirm Jackson to the US court of appeals for the DC circuit last year, told her during the hearings, “Every judge who does what you are doing is making it easier for the children to be exploited.” Graham, who previously voted for both of Barack Obama’s supreme court nominees and has now become a close ally of Donald Trump, serves as a case study in the Republican party’s move toward the far right. “Lindsey Graham is the epitome of a political parasite. He needs to have a host in order to thrive,” said Tara Setmayer, a former House Republican communications adviser who left the party in 2020. “He did it with John McCain. He did it again with Donald Trump. And now he’s doing it with the Maga/QAnon base in order to maintain relevancy.” Jim Manley, a former senior adviser to the late Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid, said it was “shocking yet not surprising” to see Senate Republicans resorting to such tactics. “It was one thing to work in the Senate and to watch traditionally conservative senators like Chuck Grassley start spouting Tea Party lines in 2009, 2010,” Manley said. “But to see more and more House and Senate Republicans spout QAnon-friendly talking points is a whole ’nother ballgame and shows to me that there’s a real poison moving through the Republican party.” It should be noted that three Senate Republicans – Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney – supported Jackson’s nomination. When Murkowski and Romney announced their support earlier this week, the extremist congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene responded by explicitly accusing Jackson and her supporters of endorsing child sexual abuse. “Any Senator voting to confirm #KJB is pro-pedophile just like she is,” Greene said on Twitter. “You are either a Senator that supports child rapists, child pornography, and the most vile child predators. Or you are a Senator who protects children and votes NO to KJB!” Setmayer warned that Republican leaders’ refusal to condemn the rhetoric of Greene and her ilk will only encourage lawmakers to offer more appeals to QAnon supporters. “They are in the driver’s seat of today’s Republican party, as much as the establishment wants to deny that,” Setmayer said. “And not only is it dangerous, but it undermines our democracy, when people like this are given a platform and are given power.” Manley echoed that point, warning that some Republicans’ embrace of conspiracy theories will make it all the more difficult for Congress to pass even the most basic legislation, such as government funding bills. “I’ve been saying for years the Senate is broken. But what I saw during these confirmation hearings has got me really concerned about our fundamental ability to legislate,” Manley said. “This is far beyond anything that I’ve ever seen before in my time on Capitol Hill.” And there are no signs of this increased extremism among Republican members of Congress diminishing anytime soon. According to Media Matters, at least 59 congressional candidates in the 2022 election cycle have expressed some level of support for QAnon. The success of those candidates would allow the QAnon-supporting faction in Congress to expand its ranks after the midterm elections in November. If that happens, the vicious attacks seen during Jackson’s confirmation hearings may become all too common."
Ketanji Brown Jackson’s blazing trail to become the first Black female justice,2022-04-07T18:04:09Z,Ed Pilkington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7gj5,"Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the US supreme court shatters several glass ceilings in America’s long struggle to form a more perfect union. Not only will she be the first Black woman to sit on the court since it assembled in 1790. She will also be the first justice with experience as a public defender to join a bench that has hosted many former prosecutors. When Jackson takes her seat on the nine-justice panel, following Stephen Breyer’s retirement probably in June, she will also raise its female contingent to four – a historic number that brings a majority of female justices within reach. On a more personal level, her promotion to the supreme court is the fulfillment of her ambition to excel at the law which she has nurtured from a young age. It is the realization of the promise given to her by her parents, who were themselves brought up under the ignominies of racial segregation in the US south. As Jackson said in her opening remarks to the confirmation process: “My parents taught me that, unlike the many barriers that they had had to face growing up, my path was clearer, such that if I worked hard and believed in myself, in America I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be.” Jackson, 51, was born in Washington DC where her parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, relocated to escape Jim Crow in the great migration. The family moved back to Miami, Florida, where she spent most of her childhood. She caught the legal bug from her father who trained to be a lawyer as a mature student when she was at preschool. “He had his stack of law books on the kitchen table while I sat across from him with my stack of coloring books,” she told the Senate judiciary committee. Jackson imbibed from her parents a pride in her roots. They gave her an African name: “Ketanji Onyika”, meaning “lovely one”. Born in 1970, Jackson describes herself as a child of the 70s. She was aware that the educational and other opportunities she enjoyed as a member of a burgeoning Black professional class were a product of the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 60s. After Miami Palmetto senior high school she studied as an undergraduate at Harvard, followed by Harvard law school. It was at college that she met her husband, a surgeon, Patrick Jackson; they have two daughters, Talia, 21, and Leila, 17. At her confirmation hearings, Republican senators attempted to depict Jackson as a rabid leftist in hock to socialist groups. The truth is much less dramatic: as an individual and a jurist, she has preferred compromise over conflict, evidential fact over ideology. “She was always the person trying to find the middle ground,” one of her Harvard roommates, Nina Coleman Simmons, told the Washington Post. Pressed by Republicans at the confirmation hearings to divulge her “judicial philosophy”, she insisted she had none. Rather, she relied on what she called a “methodology” based on neutrality, the facts in the case and a faithful reading of the law. Jackson emphasized at the confirmation hearings that her outlook was influenced by her wider family. She has two uncles who were police officers in Miami while her brother, Ketajh, worked for the Baltimore police department before joining the Maryland army national guard. Jackson did not mention that she had another uncle, Thomas Brown, who was sentenced to life in prison for minor non-violent drug offenses under a brutal three-strikes law. He was released in 2017 after Obama commuted his sentence, but died soon after. We do not know, given her near silence on the issue, whether Thomas’s plight influenced her decision to work as a federal public defender in Washington. It is notable that during the two years she spent in that role she successfully challenged several cases involving excessively long sentences. Republicans sought to cast doubt on her sentencing of sex offenders, implying she was sympathetically lenient towards them, but factcheckers have found her approach to have been entirely unremarkable for such cases. In probably her most famous district court ruling, in 2019 she ordered the former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify before Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian interference. Rejecting Donald Trump’s claim of executive privilege, she stated: “The primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that presidents are not kings.” Trump was also the subject of one of the few cases she has adjudicated on the federal appellate court in Washington since Joe Biden nominated her last year. In December she ruled for a second time against Trump, finding that the congressional committee investigating the Capitol insurrection on January 6 had a right to see White House records. Jackson’s arrival on the highest court will not change its six conservative to three liberal-leaning power balance. But given that supreme court justices are appointed for life, she could serve for three decades or more and in so doing help to shape the country’s judicial landscape for at least a generation. There will be no honeymoon period: she will be flung immediately into some extremely thorny cases in her debut October 2022 term. She has said that she will recuse herself from one of the most politically charged cases on the docket – challenges to affirmative action at Harvard and the University of North Carolina – given her current role with Harvard’s board of overseers. But there are many more highly contentious cases already piling up, including a dispute over the Clean Water Act relating to wetlands, a look at welfare laws for Native American children, and the question of whether artists, in this case a website designer, can be obliged to do work celebrating gay marriage when it goes against their religious beliefs. Her initiation to the nation’s highest court is already shaping up to be a blockbuster."
Russia suspended from human rights council after UN general assembly vote,2022-04-07T16:17:32Z,David Smith in Washington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pf3,"Russia has been suspended from the United Nations’ leading human rights body as its invasion of Ukraine continues to provoke revulsion and outrage around the world. At a meeting of the UN general assembly on Thursday, 93 members voted in favour of the diplomatic rebuke while 24 were against and 58 abstained. This met the required threshold of a two-thirds majority of the assembly members that vote yes or no, with abstentions not counting in the calculation. “War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted in response. “Grateful to all member states which … chose the right side of history.” The US ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, had launched the effort to suspend Russia from the 47-member human rights council with the world still recoiling from images of mass graves and corpses strewn in the streets of Bucha following Russian soldiers’ retreat. Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine’s UN ambassador, introducing the resolution before the 193 members of the general assembly, said Russia has committed “horrific human rights violations and abuses that would be equated to war crimes and crimes against humanity”. Kyslytsya added: “Russia’s actions are beyond the pale. Russia is not only committing human rights violations, it is shaking the underpinnings of international peace and security.” Russia’s deputy ambassador, Gennady Kuzmin, urged members to vote against the resolution. “What we’re seeing today is an attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and total control,” he said. “We reject the untruthful allegations against us, based on staged events and widely circulated fakes.” Kyslytsya responded to Russia’s complaints about the proceeding, saying: “We have heard, many times, the same perverted logic of the aggressor trying to present itself as the victim.” Among countries voting against the resolution were China, an ally of Moscow that has declined to criticise the invasion, Iran, the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan and communist Cuba, as well as Belarus, Syria and Russia itself. The 58 nations that abstained included Brazil, India, Mexico, Senegal and South Africa, with many urging diplomacy instead. TS Tirumurti, India’s ambassador, said: “When innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option.” Russian forces have been accused of multiple war crimes since the invasion of neighbouring Ukraine on 24 February. They include indiscriminate bombing, rape, torture and summary executions. Chuck Schumer, the US Senate majority leader, has accused Russia of committing “genocide”. Russia is the first permanent member of the UN security council to have its membership revoked from any UN body. It is also only the second country to have its membership rights stripped at the human rights council, which was established in 2006. The assembly suspended Libya in 2011 when upheaval in the north African country toppled its longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi. The human rights council is based in Geneva and its members are elected by the 193-nation general assembly in New York for three-year terms. The March 2006 resolution that established the rights council says the assembly may suspend membership rights of a country “that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights”. Thursday’s resolution expressed “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly at the reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights”. Thomas-Greenfield wrote on Twitter: “An important and historic day. Countries from around the globe have voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. We have collectively sent a clear message that Russia will be held accountable.” Kuzmin of Russia described its adoption as an “illegitimate and politically motivated step with the aim of demonstrably punishing a sovereign member state of the UN conducing an independent domestic and foreign policy”. He said Russia had decided to give up its membership of the council with immediate effect. A British representative raised a point of order and observed: “That sounds like someone that’s just been fired tendering their resignation.”"
The Guardian view on non-dom tax status: them not us,2022-04-07T17:48:03Z,Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p8c,"It is not the legality of what the chancellor of the exchequer and his wife do with their money that matters; it’s the message that their choice sends about inequality and unfairness in Britain today. Rishi Sunak lives in Downing Street with his wife and their two children. As chancellor of the exchequer, he is in charge of the UK’s tax system and the country’s finances at a time when everybody’s living costs are soaring and public money is extremely tight. Mr Sunak naturally pays UK taxes on his earnings and assets. His wife, Akshata Murty, does not. Although she has lived here for much of the past decade, Ms Murty holds non-domiciled tax status in the UK. This means that she pays no UK tax on her overseas earnings, on the basis that her permanent home is not here. Ms Murty is very, very rich indeed. Her stake in her Indian father’s technology business alone is worth an estimated £690m. She would have received around £11.5m in dividends from these shares in the last tax year. If she was a UK taxpayer, the Treasury would have taxed that at a rate of 38.1%, bringing in well over £4m a year to the public finances. Ms Murty has broken no law by shielding that money from the Treasury. Her office stresses that she has also paid overseas taxes on the earnings. The UK’s independent adviser on ministerial interests has approved the arrangements. Non-dom tax status, after all, has existed since the colonial era. Regrettably, it remains legal. It is based on the idea that while a person may live here all year round, as Ms Murty does, they regard a foreign country, in this case India, as their true home. At the last count, some 75,700 individuals claimed non-dom status, thus depriving the Treasury of nearly £8bn in taxes and national insurance. But the overwhelming majority of taxpayers who live in this country do not have this option. That is why the Sunak-Murty finances matter. At a time when personal taxes have just gone up, when the cost of living is rising steeply, when inflation is increasing, and when benefits are falling in value in real terms – and when Mr Sunak is the all-powerful minister responsible for every single one of these issues – the revelation of his rich wife’s choice of non-dom status sends a message that there is one law for the rich and another law for the rest of us. This may be legal, but it is, quite simply, unfair. For the Conservative government, and for Mr Sunak in particular, this is a serious moment. The partygate revelations, whose repercussions are far from over, caused Tory fortunes to plunge precisely because they showed that the sacrifices ordinary people were making for the common good were not being taken seriously by their rulers. This new disclosure says something similar. A less complacent government than this one has now become would surely have seen this embarrassment coming. It is another big blow to Mr Sunak’s reputation and ambitions, after a shabbily constructed spring financial statement and a steep downturn in the chancellor’s popularity ratings with the public and the party. His position as the heir apparent now looks fragile, and Boris Johnson may even decide to look for a more biddable chancellor in the summer reshuffle, assuming he survives that far. Just when the Conservatives may have hoped that the Ukraine war might conveniently push domestic concerns aside during the local election campaign, here is another reminder that this government’s loss of moral authority may in fact now be terminal."
The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s energy strategy: missed opportunities,2022-04-07T17:47:18Z,Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zat,"A few weeks after the November Cop26 summit concluded in Glasgow, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy published a striking snapshot of public attitudes towards the climate emergency. It showed that popular support for renewable energy, including onshore wind farms, had reached record levels. Given a cost-of-living crunch caused by the rocketing price of fossil fuels, and the new priority of energy independence following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an imaginative and proactive government would move to harness this enthusiasm and seize the moment. Sadly, Britain is not blessed with such a government. The future energy strategy unveiled by Boris Johnson on Thursday instead carries some of the hallmarks of his flawed government: a prime ministerial penchant for grands projets that may or may not be deliverable; a tendency to be unduly influenced by vocal lobby groups on the right of the Conservative party; and a propensity to set targets without doing the necessary work to enable them to be met. The aspiration that 95% of the UK’s electricity should come from renewable sources by 2030 is admirable, and the commitment to hugely increase offshore wind and solar capacity is significant. But inexplicable lacunae and wrong priorities make this a tale of missed opportunities. The government has placed nuclear power at the heart of its approach, promising that as many as eight new reactors will be built. The realpolitik of meeting net zero targets means that nuclear, as a least worst option, should be part of the future energy mix. But the scale of Mr Johnson’s ambition represents a hugely expensive long-term gamble, the funding of which is conveniently buried somewhere in the long grass. According to the government’s own calculations, the journey from initial investment in a plant to the generation of electricity takes up to 17 years. Meanwhile, far faster routes to fulfilling net zero obligations and driving down spiralling fuel bills have been rejected or ignored. Four out of five members of the public support the use of onshore wind farms, which could be built quickly and cheaply if planning rules were eased. This was rumoured to be on the cards. But Mr Johnson has instead bowed to the nimby instincts of Tory MPs and ministers, whose views are at odds with the mood of the country, but who have the power to make life difficult in parliament. Limited consultations with some “supportive” communities will have next to no impact and a game-changing possibility has been lost. A golden chance to fund greater energy efficiency and better insulation in Britain’s leaky housing stock has also been missed, despite the relief this would afford the less well-off in particular. The Treasury’s apparent refusal to fund the expansion of an existing scheme to help poorer households is particularly callous, given the eye-watering bills that will drop on doormats next winter. But it is also emblematic of an administration that consistently fails to grasp the bigger picture. Promoting demand-side energy efficiency is fundamental in the drive to net zero, but the government must make the transition to green energy attractive, feasible and affordable if people are to take the plunge in their own homes. The public knows that radical action is needed to cope with long-term and short-term energy crises. This flawed strategy for the future demonstrates that the government has yet to find the courage to rise to the challenge."
Spain reverses plan to open borders to Britons without Covid vaccine ,2022-04-07T17:40:44Z,Geneva Abdul,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pcn,"The Spanish tourist board in London has performed a U-turn on its announcement that the country will open its borders to unvaccinated British holidaymakers. The tourist office first told travellers that Spain would open up to all Britons, regardless of vaccine status, as long as they could provide a negative pre-departure test. But, in the latest disruption to the Easter holidays, the decision was reversed within hours. The rapid about-turn was due to what the tourist board called a “miscommunication” due to a “misinterpretation” of entry requirements published by the Spanish health department. “We apologise unreservedly,” Pedro Medina, the deputy director of the Spanish Tourist Office in the UK, said in a statement. British travellers aged 12 and above are still required to show proof of being fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to arrival in Spain, or to show a recovery certificate from coronavirus within a 180-day period of testing positive. The tourist office added: “If more than 270 days have passed since the final dose, certification of a booster vaccination is also required, except for teenagers aged 12 to 17 inclusive.” On Twitter, Julia Lo Bue-Said, the chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership group, the UK’s largest independent consortium of travel agents and travel management companies, called the reversal a “spectacular blunder” and “just madness”. However, children aged 12-17 are able to get into the country provided they show a negative PCR test within 72 hours of arrival in Spain. The announcement was first made in February when the Spanish government said children aged 12-17 from non-EU countries no longer needing to be fully vaccinated. Spain, one of the UK’s most popular overseas holiday destinations, is among several EU destinations requiring anyone who was vaccinated more than 270 days ago to have a booster to enter the country."
Sir Alex Ferguson’s Clan Des Obeaux wins Betway Bowl at Aintree,2022-04-07T17:31:32Z,Greg Wood at Aintree,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pk2,"Sir Alex Ferguson was celebrating on Merseyside for the second year running on Thursday as Clan Des Obeaux, the best horse he has owned in nearly 25 years in racing, took the Betway Bowl on the opening day of the Grand National meeting at Aintree. The former Manchester United manager had an interest in two runners in the race, and the money beforehand suggested that Protektorat, from the Dan Skelton yard, was fancied to land the first Grade One win of his career. Clan Des Obeaux was always travelling sweetly for Harry Cobden, however, at a track that plays to his strengths, and despite idling on the run-in he got home by a length from the Irish Gold Cup winner, Conflated. “We couldn’t believe the price he went out to,” Ferguson said. “Protektorat was a worthy favourite but maybe the Gold Cup [in which he finished third] had just taken a bit out of him. “Racing is part of my life more than football now. I’ve a few with [co-owner] Ged [Mason] and John Hales and we got great enjoyment last year winning three Grade Ones here. I never won three in a row at Anfield, that’s for sure. I need to speak to Paul [Nicholls] about the Grand National [next year]. He will be 11 and it is probably the one thing to try at his age.” There was a dramatic conclusion and aftermath to the Anniversary 4YO Hurdle earlier on the card as Knight Salute and Pied Piper initially dead-heated for first in the Grade One event, before Knight Salute was awarded the spoils in the stewards’ room. The stewards decided that Pied Piper had impeded Knight Salute by jumping left at the final flight, despite being told by Paddy Brennan, his rider, that he had not lost any momentum and that he felt a dead heat was “a very fair result”. Davy Russell, meanwhile, told the officials that he had gone too soon on the 10-11 favourite. “I knew riding the race it was completely wrong,” Russell said, “but he travelled so well and my hands were tied.” Milton Harris, whose colourful life and career has included drinking sessions with Cary Grant, dating Belinda Carlisle and seven years without a licence after being declared bankrupt, was celebrating his first Grade One success. “It doesn’t sit easy with me as they’ve had a good battle,” Harris said. “I was happy with the original result but the stewards have a job to do. “When he [Pied Piper] has given him a bump, that has probably helped him. He is a hardy warrior.” Sam Waley-Cohen, one of Britain’s top amateur riders for more than two decades, said he will retire from the saddle after riding Noble Yeats, owned by his father Robert, in Saturday’s Grand National. Waley-Cohen, 39, was the first amateur to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup for 30 years when he steered Long Run to victory in 2011, and also won the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park on the same horse in 2011 and 2012."
British man and son missing after dive off coast of Malaysia,2022-04-07T17:30:35Z,Geneva Abdul,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pj7,"Rescuers are searching for a British father and son off the coast of Malaysia after the pair disappeared on Wednesday during a group training dive. Adrian Chesters, 46, and his 14-year-old son, Nathen, were diving off the coast of Mersing, in the southern state of Johor. Alexia Alexandra Molina, 18, from France, also remains unaccounted for. Police said on Thursday that they still believed the divers would be found. The district chief, Cyril Edward Nuing, said: “With their equipment, their full gear and their experience, we believe there is a strong chance of finding them alive.” Diving has since been suspended off Mersing, with the boat’s skipper detained by police amid the investigation. Diving instructor Kristine Grodem, 35, who was training the group for their advanced licences, has been found safe after becoming separated from the group. An hour into the dive, alarms were raised after the group did not surface. According to maritime officials, Grodem was rescued by a tug boat before being airlifted from the scene. Grodem told police that the three others had managed to surface. The search resumed on Thursday morning after being called off late on Wednesday due to poor visibility. The rescue effort included two planes, 18 boats and nearly 90 personnel including rescue divers. “We cannot allow diving to continue if safety measures are compromised,” said Johor’s sultan, Ibrahim Iskandar. Malaysia reopened its borders to foreigners on 1 April after they were closed for more than two years during the Covid-19 pandemic. Malaysia’s immigration department said more than 55,000 foreigners had entered the country in the first four days since the border opened."
Trial of Greek pilot accused of murdering British wife Caroline Crouch to begin,2022-04-07T17:30:34Z,Helena Smith in Athens,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p9f,"The trial of a Greek helicopter pilot accused of strangling his British wife as she slept next to their baby daughter is due to begin on Friday in Athens. Nearly a year after Caroline Crouch was found dead in the couple’s maisonette, her husband, who had originally tried to blame the murder on ruthless “foreign thieves”, will appear before a mixed jury court in the Greek capital. It will be the first time Babis Anagnostopoulos, 33, has been seen in public since his alleged confession to a crime that has gripped the nation. “We have been waiting for this moment,” the Crouch family’s lawyer, Thanassis Haramanis, told the Guardian. “We are confident that justice will prevail.” In a trial that is likely to be as dramatic as it is long, the UK-trained aviator could take the stand within hours of the hearing getting under way. For the first time in Greek legal history the defendant, who stands accused of pre-meditated murder and attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying to police, also faces the charge of killing an animal, under groundbreaking legislation passed last year. The pilot allegedly admitted using a leash to hang Crouch’s seven-month-old puppy, Roxy, from the banister of the couple’s home in suburban Athens to make the break-in seem more realistic. Investigators encountered the choked pet before finding Caroline’s body next to her crying daughter, Lydia, on the upper level of the maisonette. “He will do everything to reduce his sentence and convince the court that Caroline’s death wasn’t pre-meditated,” Haramanis said. “But he also faces the prospect of 10 years or more in prison for killing Caroline’s puppy.” Roxy, a stray dog adopted only months before the 11 May murder, has been assigned separate legal representation, paid for by an animal welfare group that has urged members to protest outside the court alongside women’s organisations enraged at the killing – one of 17 femicides in Greece last year. For 37 days, Anagnostopoulos claimed his wife’s death was the result of a botched burglary, during which time he gave a heart-rending eulogy at her funeral on the island of Alonissos, where 20-year-old Crouch was raised. It was only after eight hours of police questioning – following his arrest at her memorial – that investigators allege he confessed to the crime. Police, who had encouraged the government to take the rare step of announcing a €300,000 (£250,000) reward for information that might lead to the assailants, said they had been fooled by a man they described as a “top-class actor”. Anagnostopoulos, who is detained in Athens’ high-security Koyrdallos prison, has claimed, through his lawyers, that his wife’s “narcissistic and aggressive behaviour” were to blame for the fit of rage that prompted him to commit the crime. But in a 24-page report, Giorgos Noulis, the public prosecutor assigned to the case, contended otherwise, saying the pilot was in a “calm state of mind” when he chose to kill the student. “He had no inhibition to go through with the act despite the fact that she was the mother of his child,” the magistrate was quoted as saying in the report, excerpts of which appeared in the Greek press. “The victim was just 20 years old, while he was 13 years older and should have been her protector.” The daughter of a retired oil executive who settled on Alonissos, Crouch had been asleep for more than two hours before her murder. Investigators, piecing together the sequence of events based on a handwritten diary that spoke of an increasingly abusive relationship, believe she threatened the pilot with divorce during a heated altercation earlier that night. Her death was depicted as “agonising” by a coroner, who estimated after examination of her body that asphyxiation “took five to six minutes”. Greek media reports describe Anagnostopoulos as having spent months poring over legal textbooks in an attempt to finesse his defence. At least four witnesses from the couple’s “broader social circle” will testify in his defence, his lawyer, Alexandros Papaioannidis, said before the trial. Haramanis said it was unclear if Crouch’s parents, who now have custody of Lydia, would attend proceedings. “Her mother can still not believe that she was consoled by the man who took her beloved daughter away,” he said. “I don’t know if they could bear to be in the same room with him.”"
"Anna Karenina review – this striking, steamy, seductive ballet is a masterpiece",2022-04-07T17:30:10Z,Elissa Blake,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7t7a,"Just before the opening of Anna Karenina, one of the most famous Russian stories of all time, a message is projected on to the stage: “The Australian Ballet opens our heart to the victims of the war in Ukraine.” It makes for a sobering prologue to this much-anticipated production, which was twice postponed by the pandemic, and now opens in Sydney on a day when the world is learning of Russian atrocities in the city of Bucha. It is a dark time to be watching this story. The ballet’s choreographer, Yuri Possokhov, was born in Lugansk, Ukraine, and trained in Moscow before joining the Bolshoi Ballet. His distilled and beautifully spare version of Leo Tolstoy’s epic tale of love, adultery, morality and duty, is a jointly commissioned production by Chicago’s Joffrey Ballet and the Australian Ballet. It is a ballet for adults rather than children: no lavish “chocolate-box” elements, no snow on stage, no one arrives in a troika, there are no ballrooms. Instead, we witness a complex psychological drama full of yearning and restraint, desire and madness, on a bare stage with little more than a bed, an easel or a hay bale to provide physical context. Robyn Hendricks, as Anna, is already a superstar of the Australian Ballet and here she is mesmerising as the young married woman expressing her full seductive power with liquid movements of her arms, draped in black velvet and lace, or a simple stretch of her neck. Later, she lets rip with partner, Callum Linnane (Anna’s lover, Count Vronksy), in one of the steamiest sex scenes in ballet. Linnane is a rising star who brings palpable heat to the role. His Vronsky is a young soldier with plenty of snap in his legs and a towering, luminous beauty. His acting isn’t as strong as Hendricks’, who is magnificent in her mad scene, but their dancing together looks effortless. Hendricks makes it clear that Anna knows their love story can never work out. One dance, in which a feverish Anna dreams of having a husband (Adam Bull as Alexei Karenin) and a lover simultaneously, is a highlight of the production. In the smaller featured roles, Benedicte Beme is bright, sharp and bouncy as the teenage debutante Kitty Shcherbatskaya, and her soon-to-be husband, Konstantin Levin, is performed beautifully by Brett Chynoweth, whose final solo is a knockout. For those in the audience who don’t already know Tolstoy’s story, it might be hard to follow. The plot isn’t spelled out but the striking and sophisticated visual images help the viewer. The train station, the racecourse and a field in the countryside are supported by projected film and glorious lighting (by David Finn) that washes over the stage. The dancers are dressed in the colours of a Rothko painting, burnt orange and red or dark shades of blue, with designer Tom Pye drawing on 19th-century underwear designs for Anna’s “undressed” looks. The music composed by Ilya Demutsky, one of the most sought-after composers in the world, is a real star of the production. The piano is often front and centre, with wind instruments rather than strings driving the emotion. At times, it sounds like a sweeping film score. Occasionally, the musicians are so quiet and still that we lean in to hear them. This production is a modern masterpiece to be savoured, a gift for those who love ballet, students of the artform and anyone who appreciates literature, design and music. Anna Karenina, the Australian Ballet, is on at the Joan Sutherland theatre, Sydney Opera House, until 23 April"
Australia relaxes summer ban on live sheep exports to Middle East ,2022-04-07T17:30:09Z,Calla Wahlquist,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mtb,"Australia has rolled back a ban on exporting sheep to the Middle East during the hottest months of the year in a move animal rights groups say ignores scientific recommendations introduced to protect animal welfare. The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment announced adjustments to the summer export ban this week, based on climatological data that it said resulted in an increased risk of heat stress in the Persian Gulf in May, and reduced risk of heat stress for sheep travelling through the Red Sea in early June. The live export of sheep to most ports in the Middle East is banned from 1 June to 14 September. But Australian exporters will be allowed to take sheep through the Red Sea to Israel from 1 to 14 June. The ban on exporting to some Persian Gulf destinations, including Qatar but not the major live export ports of Oman and Kuwait, will begin a week early on 22 May. Dr Jed Goodfellow from the Australian Alliance for Animals said the changes were contrary to the findings of a heat stress review commissioned by the government, and could result in sheep deaths. The McCarthy review, commissioned after whistleblower footage showing sheep panting and experiencing heat stress during a deadly voyage on the Awassi Express in August 2017, identified heat stress as a risk on all shipments occurring between May and October. The summer export ban, first introduced in 2019, has only ever run from June to September, to allow Australia’s two remaining live sheep exporters access to key global markets. Goodfellow said allowing sheep to be exported through the Red Sea in June would push them to their “biological limit” and risked a significant mortality event. “You get one adverse weather event, temperatures higher than expected, and basically half of the sheep on the ship could die,” he said. Goodfellow said the adjustment to the summer ban, which followed lobbying from exporters, showed that the trade would not be able to exist if all the scientific advice around reducing heat stress was followed. “It just shows the fact that the trade is fundamentally incompatible with acceptable welfare standards,” he said. “The business model is based on a degree of animal suffering, because if you act on the science and in accordance with animal welfare the trade becomes unviable very very quickly.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The agriculture department in February announced it would be conducting “additional stakeholder engagement” on its review of live sheep exports during the Middle Eastern summer, which is expected to be completed by the end of June. It also said it was funding ongoing research by LiveCorp and the export industry, which “will further ascertain and align sheep physiological and behavioural changes observed during a voyage with other data”. “This will include additional onboard data collection including using automated rumen data loggers to continuously measure sheep core body temperature,” it said. The chief executive of RSPCA Australia, Richard Mussell, said there was no need to conduct additional research. “All the data and evidence is already there – it’s just being dismissed,” he said. “Live export does not enable the most basic of animal welfare needs.” Mussell said the decision to wind back part of the summer ban was “deeply concerning”. “It’s also very worrying that these regulations have been put in place now, on the eve of a federal election being called – when parliament may not sit again for months and so may not have the chance to scrutinise these last-minute changes,” he said. Animals Australia director Lyn White said the three-month ban was “already grossly inadequate” and reducing it would “increase the perils sheep will face”. Greens senator, Mehreen Faruqui, said it was concerning that the change had been made without parliamentary oversight. “The Senate has been denied the opportunity to do its job in scrutinising these changes and considering whether to disallow them before they come into effect,” she said."
"‘Old-school, 1950s grandma food’: Australian chefs on reviving retro recipes",2022-04-07T17:30:09Z,Max Brearley,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7n83,"We all love a kitchen comeback. Think the return of meatloaf, or when, inexplicably, prawn cocktail got its groove back. Chefs are skilled at trawling the depths of nostalgia, from the trope of “I learned to cook this dish at my nana’s knee”, to mining collective food memories. “I’ve always gone back and done a lot of reading of old cookbooks,” says chef Blaze Young, who heads up the kitchen at Fremantle wine bar Nieuw Ruin. “I kind of love old-school, 1950s grandma food, and old Australiana.” Young isn’t wed to her own grandmother’s style of cooking; she also enjoys interpreting the food memories of others. One such effort, a confit fish “under a fur coat”, has become her signature dish. The childhood memories of Nieuw Ruin’s owner Dimitri Rtshiladze were the inspiration for this spin on “herring under a fur coat”. Rtshiladze, who is of Georgian descent, told Young about the eastern European classic. “Traditionally it’s made with tinned, preserved herring, and then it’s layered with cold vegetables,” she says. “I guess to make the herring a little bit more appetising.” Young uses monkfish from Scott Reef off the north-west coast of Western Australia. It is a by-catch, which she says has a “beautiful vegetal flavour” reminiscent of leeks when slowly confited. A bottom layer of blanched potatoes is dressed sparingly with pickled shallot, followed by the confit monkfish, fresh dill, then blanched carrot, roast beetroot spiked with a little bit of horseradish, with a final layer of egg salad made with a quality olive oil mayonnaise. The six layers are prepared “incredibly simply”, says Young, making them “really clean examples of that ingredient” when eaten individually but “really complex and interesting” when eaten together. The final touch is salty, smoked Yarra Valley caviar – an element of decadence for a traditionally humble dish. In Sydney, food writer Jill Dupleix’s dreams of comeback dishes were brought to life at relative newcomer, Ursula’s in Paddington. “My gran used to do the best flummery ever,” she says. “It would float off the table, and there it is at Ursula’s.” Phil Wood, chef-owner at Ursula’s, says “It used to be well known, featured in those guides to home cooking for the Australian housewife, like the CWA books, The Golden Wattle Cookery Book. [But] a lot of it has just kind of fallen by the wayside a little bit … It’s remarkable how quickly things can disappear within a generation.” While flummery’s English cousin is centuries old, the Australian version of flummery was born out of post-war necessity, says Wood. The original recipe combines packet fruit jelly and evaporated milk. The evaporated milk must be “made really cold, and when you whip, it whips up like fake cream”. The fruit jelly is left in the fridge until almost set. Then you “fold those two things together, ending up with this flavoured mousse”. While Wood is known for flawless technique, his iteration of the dish is easy to make. He uses juiced strawberries for a more natural flavouring, but it still contains the all-important evaporated milk. His is a little lighter than traditional flummery, which can be “a bit on the spongy side rather than aerated”. The dish is currently off the menu, but is due another comeback when light spring fruit is back in season. Melbourne-based chef Victor Liong of Lee Ho Fook has also mined nostalgia on occasion. “A couple of years ago [at Chinese New Year] we cooked from the Australian Women’s Weekly Chinese Cookbook. It was good fun and really well received,” he says. “But I didn’t want to go down that route [every day].” This is because, for those who didn’t grow up around the many faces of Chinese cuisine, we are still in a period of discovery when it comes to Chinese cooking. “It hasn’t quite got around for people to be like, ‘I really want that nostalgic honey prawn’,” he says. There are exceptions. “Queen Chow in Sydney does a really good job doing that, but Dan Hong is obviously doing it with a pretty serious dim sum offering as well. It’s highbrow, lowbrow, I guess.” The Australian Women’s Weekly cookbook experiment had value for Liong because it helped explore stories of the Australian Chinese experience. “There’s a recipe in [that book] called I think, Billy Kee’s pork ribs.” He says the dish was “basically a sweet soy pork ribs-type dish”. But it was “named after this guy who had a Chinese restaurant and had a really, really interesting life … It’s cool to delve into that a little bit more, and try and tie that into what it looks like on our menu.” For Young, who also has a popular riff on pie floaters and devilled livers, the joy of reviving a retro recipe is subverting expectations. “I love the idea of taking things that have fallen out of relevance, and seem really bizarre and bunky, that wouldn’t seem appetising at all and then making them really approachable and really delicious.”"
Australian Border Force searched 822 phones in 2021 despite having no power to demand passcodes,2022-04-07T17:30:09Z,Josh Taylor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7m2v,"Australian Border Force officials searched 822 travellers’ mobile phones in 2021, despite admitting it has no power to force arrivals to give them the passcode to their devices. In January, Sydney software developer James told Guardian Australia that he and his partner were stopped on their return from Fiji by border force officials who asked them to write their phone passcodes on a piece of paper before taking the codes and their phones to another room to examine for half an hour. The phones were then returned and they were allowed to leave. Border force confirmed the practice was allowed under the Customs Act, but declined to expand on how often it was used, or what officers did with the devices once unlocked. In tabled responses to questions on notice from Labor’s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, border force confirmed that in 2021 – when international travel was still limited during the Covid pandemic – officers searched 822 devices at the border, out of more than a million arriving or departing travellers. In a written response to questions raised by the Greens digital rights spokesperson, Nick McKim, border force has confirmed there is no legal obligation for people to hand over their passcodes. “There is no legal compulsion for a traveller to provide a password/passcode or provide assistance to an electronic device at the border,” border force said. But if a person refuses to comply with the request and a border force officer considers there to be “a risk to the border” then border force can seize the device for further examination. There is no limit on time for how long the devices can be held for, but the agency said the policy is to keep devices for no longer than 14 days, unless it will take longer to examine the device. Border force said a phone would only be seized where officers suspect it has “special forfeited goods” such as “illegal pornography, terrorism-related material and media that has been, or would be, refused classification”. McKim said border force officials should be required to get a warrant before going through people’s phones. “It’s generally the requirement in Australia and it should be no different at the border,” he said. “Australia’s privacy protections need considerable strengthening so people’s phones aren’t examined on a hunch, or confiscated under the shadow of being referred to other authorities.” McKim said there needs to be more transparency from border force about what data had been collected from the searches, who has access to it and how it is stored. Border force said devices were scanned by another device, rather than manually checked by officers. “Only trained ABF officers will undertake examinations of electronic devices,” border force said. “The examination process involves the connection of the device to examination equipment and the review of the data stored on the device to determine a subsequent course of action.” Travellers cannot be present during the examination “for operational and security reasons”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning James, and others who expressed concerns about having their phones searched at the border, raised questions about border force officers going through their work files, or other items stored in the cloud and not on their device. Border force confirmed it does not have the power to access these files without a warrant. Border force said officers also have the power to make copies of documents related to any offence against a prescribed act, or information relevant to the work of Australia’s spy agencies. “Any copied information is stored securely and is subject to current ABF established security guidelines,” it said. “The ABF does not alter or delete any data as a result of an examination of a device under the Customs or Migration acts.” The data can be shared “depending on the type of information and the specific legislation that applies to that type of information”."
Craig Kelly billed taxpayers to fly to Melbourne anti-lockdown rallies ,2022-04-07T17:30:09Z,Christopher Knaus,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7n5v,"Craig Kelly is being investigated for billing taxpayers to fly to anti-vaccine mandate, anti-lockdown rallies in Melbourne, internal records show. Kelly, the leader of the United Australia party, charged taxpayers for his flights to and from Melbourne for two rallies in November and December last year, which were organised chiefly as protests against Victoria’s pandemic powers and the Victorian premier, Dan Andrews. The rallies were also used to protest Covid vaccination generally, particularly for children, and vaccine passports. Kelly was a prominent figure at both rallies. At the first protest, Kelly told the crowd that Australia was being “governed by medical bureaucrats that are part of a mad, insane cult” and said the UAP would “bring Daniel Andrews to his knees” after the next election. At the second rally, Kelly complained that he was unable to hire a rental car because he “refused to show his Covid-19 vaccine certificate” and said he was “no longer in a great city, I am here in a fascist medical state”. The Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Ipea) is probing whether Kelly, as a “backbench parliamentarian with a suburban Sydney electorate”, was allowed to charge taxpayers for the flights to Melbourne. It is also investigating his use of the government car service Comcar to travel from Melbourne airport on the day of the first rally. The watchdog began investigating Kelly’s travel after media reports about his speeches in Melbourne. “Upon investigation it was found that parliamentary business resources were used by Mr Kelly to travel to Melbourne on 13 November 2021 (returning same day) and on 3 December 2021 (returning 5 December 2021),” an initial assessment, released under freedom of information laws, found. “On the basis of the findings of this preliminary assessment, and in accordance with IPEA’s protocol on dealing with misuse of parliamentary work expenses, it is recommended IPEA proceeds with an assurance review into this matter to determine the dominant purpose of Mr Kelly’s use of travel resources.” The Guardian understands Ipea’s investigation is ongoing. Kelly said his travel was clearly parliamentary business. He said he had a private member’s bill before federal parliament on vaccine passports at the time, and was the leader of the UAP, speaking on national issues. “I was lobbying support for that [private member’s bill] across the nation,” he told the Guardian. “If that’s not parliamentary business, nothing is.” “If I was any member of parliament, such a large public rally would be parliamentary business that you went to it. The fact that I had a private member’s bill, or a couple of private members’ bills before parliament at that stage, I think makes it a direct [matter of parliamentary business].” “It wasn’t a conference on Hamilton Island or something like that.” Kelly said he had kept his costs down by flying economy to Melbourne and returning on the same day. “Sydney to Melbourne, Melbourne to Brisbane, I always fly economy, because I think that’s what the public would expect of a parliamentary backbencher,” he said. It is unclear how much Kelly charged taxpayers for the flights and Comcar. Ipea is yet to publicly release data for the last quarter of 2021 and the internal records do not show how much the flights cost."
Spiderbait celebrate bandmate Janet English: ‘She’s one of the greats of Australian music’,2022-04-07T17:30:08Z,Andrew Stafford,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mpp,"In the near-decade since Spiderbait last released an album, their bass player and singer, Janet English, has completed a bachelor’s degree in psychology. She’s not sure if she wants to practise. “I was just really interested in how the brain works,” she says. English is the owner of one of the most interesting brains in Australian music. At school, she excelled as a gymnast as well as at hockey, mime, theatre and art, before forming Spiderbait in 1991 with singing drummer Mark Maher (better known as Kram) and guitarist Damian Whitty (Whitt) in the Riverina town of Finley, New South Wales. Kram was an accomplished musician but, back then, English could barely make it from one end of a song to the other. “She’s kind of an accidental hero in a way,” Kram says. “She was a painter and artist who sort of stumbled into music through her friends and then discovered that she had these incredible talents.” Kram talks like he plays drums, at an overdriven mile a minute. English is more reticent. With Spiderbait marking their 30th anniversary last year, Kram had an idea: to celebrate English’s work in a single 33-track compilation, Songs in the Key of J. It features almost everything English has contributed to the band. That includes many of their most loved tunes, sung in English’s distinctively high and soft register: the acoustic-electric pop thrash of Calypso, the winking Fucken Awesome, and the glorious Jackson Five homage Stevie – songs that walked a tightwire of whimsy and cynicism, naivety and irony, humour and melancholy. It’s unusual for a group with three distinctive songwriters to release a single member’s work in one package. Most bands argue – and many break up – over songwriting credits, royalties and egos. But Spiderbait share everything equally, a trait of other bands with longevity on their side, including U2. English was not keen when Kram floated the idea but figured it would be one of many Spiderbait ideas that never came to fruition. “I have to credit Kram, he’s such a champion,” English says. “He’s an amazing musician but he’s so open to other people’s input, and respectful of what they bring to the table.” The band’s inclusive spirit was a product of the punk and hardcore scene from which they emerged. “We went and saw Dinosaur Jr in 1989 and they had a woman playing bass [Donna Dresch],” English says. “I think it was one of those nights where it felt like half of Melbourne tumbled out of the Prince of Wales [hotel] and went, ‘Let’s form a band.’” They quickly became indie-radio favourites and mainstays of the festival circuit. Their third album, Ivy and the Big Apples, released in 1996, went double platinum; its Kram-written lead single, Buy Me a Pony, topped the Triple J Hottest 100 poll, making Spiderbait the first Australian band to achieve the feat. The group pulled back a little after that. “I remember feeling like the gigs were getting out of hand, I was a bit over it all and I just wanted to retreat back into the studio,” English says. Their next album, Grand Slam, saw her dabbling with electronica and “all the pop stuff I grew up with in the late 70s and early 80s”. Sales dipped and, after 2001’s The Flight of Wally Funk, recordings became sparse: Tonight Alright, which featured their hit cover of Black Betty, was released in 2004, then nine years passed until a self-titled follow-up. Geography has played a part: English lives in Melbourne, Whitt in Ballarat and Kram near Byron Bay, where his home was just flooded. Kram says Songs in the Key of J is the second instalment of a trilogy of releases. The first was a reissue of Ivy and the Big Apples for its 25th anniversary. The third will be a new album, to be cut this year. “We’re having this beautiful renaissance on stage and we feel like we need to do the same thing on record,” Kram says. But for now, he says, it’s all about English. “She’s one of the greats of Australian music to me, and I think me and Whitt benefited from playing with her as much as she did with us,” Kram says. He draws a parallel with Magic Dirt’s Adalita, with whom Spiderbait played often: “The two of them are like the sun and the moon.” He describes Songs in the Key of J as akin to a solo album but in the context of Spiderbait. It’s probably the closest English will ever come to making one. “I’ve got creative control, I’ve got two amazing collaborators, so there hasn’t been that burning George Harrison post-Beatles desire to just show everyone,” she says. “I’ve been very lucky in that regard.” Songs in the Key of J is out now through Universal"
No Hard Feelings by Genevieve Novak review – another hot-mess-millennial novel,2022-04-07T17:30:08Z,Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7tde,"The lives of women in their twenties and thirties are ripe for unpacking: it’s a time of great change, personal epiphanies and coming into one’s own. Over the past few years, the enormous popularity of Sally Rooney and her ilk proves that there is a constant hunger for these stories, especially since the ugly truths and minutiae of women’s lives have historically been sidelined. From covers to content, “sad girl lit” is undoubtedly a current literary trend. It almost always centre on white, heterosexual, middle-class women; while their struggles are valid, they’ve got a lot to fall back on. Some of the books in this field are startlingly original and insightful – Meg Mason’s 2020 novel Sorrow and Bliss is a wry, intelligent exploration of living with mental illness – and some follow a more predictable trajectory of overcoming adversity to find contentment. Melbourne novelist Genevieve Novak’s debut No Hard Feelings slots neatly into the second category. It follows Penny Moore, a typical 26-year-old who lives in an inner-city sharehouse and works under a punishing micromanager at a digital marketing agency. She drinks too much. She spends endless hours swiping on dating apps. She is hopelessly in love with an ex-boyfriend, who sees her as a convenient hookup. Her longtime best friends are making strides in their lives: Annie is a lawyer with a promising new girlfriend, and Bec has recently become engaged. While once their trio seemed unbreakable, Penny feels as if she’s falling behind. The novel is a laundry list of Melbourne hotspots and cultural references: Novak namechecks inner-northern pubs and bars, indie bands and TV shows. The ex is a laughable cliche: a PhD student with a passion for Radiohead, vinyl, Doc Martens and op-shopped clothing. And the scenes at Penny’s workplace are excruciating in their replication of digital marketing jargon, especially when written in email form. If it weren’t so incredibly earnest, much of it could read as parody – and I say that as someone who is very much a part of this world. To Novak’s credit, she works some diversity into her novel in a way that mostly feels natural. Penny’s friends are queer and people of colour (facts mentioned only in passing or through implication), and there’s a self-awareness in the characters that reflects the shifting social tides. But this sometimes reads like shallow buzzword regurgitation, such as when Penny thinks: “I have such respect for an ethically sound company led almost exclusively by women, several of them women of colour.” Like so many women in so many of these books, Penny is a hot mess. She is a master of self-sabotage. Her inner monologue is often unkind, to herself and to others; there are various instances of fatphobia throughout the novel, and perhaps they are there to illustrate the vapid concerns of twentysomethings, but it is still uncomfortable to read. Penny’s solipsism is not unique – it’s largely the driving force of these very interior novels. But given the ubiquity of this kind of writing at the moment, it all starts feeling like white noise rather than profound insight. The rise of therapy among millennials makes its way into this novel in a way that’s more gratifying. Penny’s sessions with her psychologist Dr Minnick call to mind the patient-doctor relationship in the excellent television show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Dr Minnick’s dialogue sometimes reads like a self-help book, but Novak’s intent is admirable. There are many similarities to British author Dolly Alderton’s 2020 novel Ghosts, not least the fact that the elusive objects of both protagonists’ affections share a first name. Like Penny, Alderton’s narrator Nina finds herself casting unfair judgment on her friends in light of her own romantic failures. The contrast is that Nina’s journey ends not with romance, but acceptance that her life may not mirror the conventional path. Nina, though, is in her early thirties – what a difference a few years may make. While Penny concedes by the end of No Hard Feelings that rewards can be found in new beginnings, or simply living in the moment, and not only in fairytale endings, her happiness still comes from external sources: a steady boyfriend, a higher-paying job. Perhaps this is simply the reality of living under capitalism in the west – even when emotional peace is the goal, these traditional arbiters of success continue to signify a satisfying ending.

"What is Boris Johnson’s energy plan, and what is it missing?",2022-04-07T17:18:38Z,Rob Davies and Peter Walker,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p7t,"Boris Johnson claimed on Thursday that his energy security strategy had delivered “clean, affordable, secure power to the people for generations to come”. In comments issued as he launched the policy at Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset and put atomic energy front and centre of his plan, the prime minister said his government was the first for years that had not “dodged the big decisions on energy”. Yet within hours, critics spoke of a lack of ambition, particularly around onshore wind and energy efficiency, avenues that experts say offer the best and quickest hope of bringing down bills and achieving energy self-sufficiency. So what exactly is in the plan and what is missing from it? Nuclear Peak winter electricity demand is about 60 gigawatts and National Grid expects that to be 85GW by 2050, as vehicles and home heating are increasingly electrified, with a safety buffer needed on top of that. Johnson has set a target of 25% of electricity coming from nuclear. That means increasing capacity from 7GW to 24GW by 2050, an effort to be overseen by a new body, Great British Nuclear. The first phase will involve eight new nuclear reactors, equivalent to four 3GW power stations. Sizewell C is set for approval within this parliamentary term. Two more will follow in the next, with Wylfa on Anglesey the front-runner. After that, projects could be located at approved sites such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. Small nuclear reactors of nearly 0.5GW each will be part of the mix, with both Rolls-Royce and GE Hitachi working on projects. The recently approved “regulated asset base” funding model will transfer risk to the taxpayer, allaying risk-aversion among private firms, which has stymied recent development. Ministers have not ruled out taking a stake in individual plants. There will, however, be no nuclear power plants in Scotland, whose parliament has reaffirmed its opposition. Wind “We will be the Saudi Arabia of wind power,” the government claims. Offshore wind targets have been scaled up, from 40GW to 50GW, with planning reforms intended to cut delivery times, which can be up to 13 years. But Tory infighting has turned onshore into a sore point. A leaked version of the energy plan, first reported by the i newspaper, include a target of 45GW by 2035, up from nearly 15GW now. That disappeared in the final document, after anti-wind Tory MPs refused to countenance overhauling planning laws that make onshore all but impossible to develop in England. The government says it will look at offering local communities cheaper electricity bills in return for their consent but will not rip up those obstructive planning rules. No such prohibition exists in Scotland, which is better suited to onshore than England thanks to greater wind speeds and more remote locations. In a TV clip at Hinkley Point C, Johnson said onshore turbines were “controversial with people”. “People feel that they affect the beauty of the countryside, I totally understand that.” However, polling by YouGov in 2021 shows two thirds of people support onshore wind projects, even in rural areas. Solar Solar is in line for one of the biggest expansions. The plan envisages a fivefold increase that could take the total capacity from 14GW to 70GW by 2035. Unlike onshore wind, this could be underpinned by planning reform that favours development on non-protected sites. Energy efficiency The energy security plan contains no major new investment in upgrading leaky homes to make them easier and cheaper to heat, despite the price of gas – the heat source for 90% of homes – hitting historic highs. As recently as 2012, the UK was upgrading 2.3m homes a year thanks to government funding that was cut when David Cameron vowed to eliminate “green crap”, slowing the rate to a trickle. The energy security plan offers very little to reignite that drive to insulate the UK, enraging environmental groups. Oil and gas The government’s renewable proposals have been accompanied by firmer support for oil and gas, further inflaming the ire of environmentalists. North Sea drillers will be encouraged to seek new licences, although the government hasn’t quantified what impact it expects this to have on production. Having banned fracking in 2019, the government will commission an “impartial” review by the British Geological Survey into whether it can be done safely."
Liverpool finalise deal to sign Fabio Carvalho from Fulham for £5m,2022-04-07T15:18:14Z,Fabrizio Romano and Sachin Nakrani,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p4t,"Liverpool have finalised a deal for Fabio Carvalho that will take the exciting winger from Fulham for £5m plus add-ons in the summer, ending a chase the club failed to complete on deadline day of the most recent transfer window. Carvalho was ready to swap west London for Merseyside in January after negotiations led to a £8.4m fee being agreed upon – Fulham had rejected Liverpool’s opening offer of £5m – but ultimately time ran out for the transfer. Jürgen Klopp never lost interest in the 19-year-old, however, and with his contract ending in the summer, was determined to sign him before he became a free agent and thus hugely attractive to rival bidders. That was relatively easy to organise given Carvalho had agreed personal terms with Liverpool, as well as completing a medical, when he appeared set to join them a little over two months ago. He will now do so on 1 July – when his contract with Fulham expires – with the transfer expected to be officially announced next month. The add-on payments will be in the region of £2.7m, with Liverpool also agreeing to a £20% sell-on fee. There are no plans for Carvalho to be loaned back to Fulham. Carvalho, who can also operate as an attacking midfielder, was born in Portugal but is an England Under-21 international. He progressed through Fulham’s academy and having made his debut in a 2-0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in September 2020, quickly became a first-team regular. He has made 31 appearances for Marco Silva’s side in all competitions this season, scoring eight goals and providing seven assists, and could well face Fulham next season given they appear poised for an immediate return to the Premier League as Championship champions. They are top of the division, five points clear of second-place Bournemouth and 17 points clear of third-place Huddersfield. Carvalho’s contract with Liverpool will last until 2027 and he is expected to be on their pre-season tour to the far east before the 2022-23 campaign."
Rishi Sunak will never have to face the stark choice of ‘eat or heat’,2022-04-07T17:16:54Z,Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y79tb,"John Harris’s article rightly pointed out that the government “seems split between indifference and paralysed panic” in its response to the “economic calamity being loaded on to the poorest people” (‘Cost of living crisis’? No – this is a social emergency that will define who we are, 3 April). I would argue that its response can be characterised by a mixture of cynicism and inertia that sees it behind the curve on almost every front, not just the cost-of-living bombshell. Cynicism because Rishi Sunak believes that he only needs to throw a few crumbs to “hard-working” families now and save the real loaf as a pre-election bribe to voters. Surely it must be obvious to voters, as well as to Tory backbenchers, that Sunak simply does not get it? And how could he be expected to, when his family fortune runs into hundreds of millions? If only the government would instead call in Martin Lewis. He does get that the poorest and the vulnerable are suffering the worst right now; he cares about their plight; he would know which economic levers to pull to help; and he would put windfall tax revenue to good use now, not in early 2024. Andy Jinman Worthing, West Sussex • John Harris’s excellent exposé of poverty in the UK points out that absolute poverty is defined as being “a household income less than 60% of the median income level of 2010-11, adjusted for inflation”. However, this definition is self-evidently couched in relative terms. If it is to have a real and distinct meaning, “absolute poverty” should be used to refer to an extreme applying universally to human circumstances regardless of place and time, and to the inability to satisfy the most basic human needs where survival is threatened. This is not to underplay the importance of seeking to improve the conditions of poor people, however defined, but the erosion of conceptual distinction in the use of these terms, by the same kind of inflation of outrage that escalates mass murder to “genocide”, erodes their meaning and therefore undermines the power of advocacy associated with them. Stephen Smith Glasgow • I was incensed to read your story about the non-dom tax status of the chancellor’s wife, which allows her to save millions in tax (6 April). Her reported share dividend income of £11.5m a year equates to about £22 a minute. Perhaps these startling numbers explain why the chancellor cannot comprehend the difficulties faced by the majority of people in the UK. As people are forced with having to choose between eating or heating, just imagine what it must be like to accrue £660 while watching Corrie. What a missed opportunity that Ed Miliband’s proposal to scrap non-dom status, part of his 2015 election manifesto, did not gain the support of the British public. Nigel Hay Roke, Oxfordshire • How heartwarming to read of Rishi Sunak’s generous donation to his old school (Report, 5 April). Perhaps he didn’t realise that most public schools already benefit from the tax breaks and rate relief that come with charitable status, and if funds are getting a bit low they can always sell off a chunk of surplus land for development, as Winchester college has done. It’s a mystery to me how any organisation that charges enormous fees for its services, whether in the education or health sectors, can be classed as anything other than businesses and taxed accordingly. So next time Sunak has a bit of spare cash to dish out, I suggest he considers a genuine charity like Winchester Basics Bank, which is working round the clock to help the rapidly rising number of families with a “eat or heat” dilemma.

Regulated trophy hunting aids wildlife conservation,2022-04-07T17:15:46Z,Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p7a,"Animal cruelty is abhorrent, and we welcome actions that unambiguously increase animal welfare. However, campaigns that conflate the cruelty of elephant rides and dolphin attractions with the conservation dividends supported by sustainable hunting (Letters, 1 April) risk decreasing animal welfare and imperilling biodiversity. We are concerned that pressure from well-meaning campaigners to enact the current animals abroad bill will not in fact “lead the way on animal welfare”. In particular, calls to ban trophy imports, a major component of the bill and a sadly misguided manifesto promise, risk removing key incentives to conserve wildlife in many regions of global conservation significance. Evidence shows that removing regulated trophy hunting – and the incentives it creates for conservation – without having viable funded alternatives ready can lead to greater losses of wildlife, due to subsequent increases in illegal, unsustainable and inhumane killings of animals using snares, dogs, local weapons and poisons. A single trophy-hunted lion generates worldwide media attention, but the daily snaring and poisoning of lions in areas where they have little local value is largely ignored. Simplistic solutions to complex problems rarely work.

Energy and inflation worries mount; US jobless claims lowest since 1968 – as it happened,2022-04-07T06:47:08Z,Graeme Wearden,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7n9n,"Time to wrap up - here are today’s main stories: Goodnight, GW The Dubai-based owner of P&amp;O Ferries has lost its status as a formal partner in one of the government’s biggest freeport projects, after widespread public anger over the firing without notice of 800 workers last month. Ministers have confirmed that DP World, the Emirati logistics giant behind P&amp;O, no longer had a central role as a “partner” in the Solent freeport after the resignation of its UK commercial director from the scheme’s board last week. It comes after questions in the Lords from the Green party peer Natalie Bennett who had asked the government what plans were being put in place to withdraw any freeport contracts as a result of the sackings. Speaking for the government, Stephen Greenhalgh, a levelling up minister, responded on Wednesday night saying: “On 28 March 2022 DP World resigned from the Solent freeport board and are no longer a partner in the freeport consortium.” Here’s the full story: Europe’s stock markets ended the day lower. Worries about slowing growth, the impact of the Ukraine war, and the prospect of a series of US interest rate rises in 2022 all weighed on shares. In London, the FTSE 100 index dropped 36 points, or 0.5%, to 7552 point. Oil giant Shell lost 2.3% after reporting that exiting Russia would mean a writedown of up to $5bn. Shell also told shareholders that group cashflow in Q1 is expected to be adversely affected to the tune of around $7bn, partly due to margin calls caused by higher prices on forward delivery contracts. Insurance group Aviva (-4.9%) and housebuilder Barratt (-4.2%) led the fallers after goin ex-dividend today. Other construction firms were also lower, as the sector sets aside more money to fix fire safety problems at properties built over the last 30 years. European stocks also dipped, with Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC also down around 0.5%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sums up the day: European markets have chopped between positive and negative territory today, as investors continue to absorb the messaging from last nights Fed minutes, and the outlined plans to reduce the size of the balance sheet, by $95bn a month, and a potential start date in May. Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine don’t appear to be going anywhere in the short term with the Kremlin complaining that the US sending weapons to Ukraine wasn’t helping the talks to progress. Another view might be that increasing evidence of Russian troops murdering Ukrainian civilians might have something to do with the lack of progress. More default developments...Sovcombank has become the first Russian bank to say it will miss a payment on foreign-currency bonds due to sanctions imposed on the nation since its invasion of Ukraine. Bloomberg explains: Russia’s ninth-largest lender was due to make a $12 million interest payment on notes maturing in 2030 on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, but the bank said in a statement that it would stop payments on four notes issued by an Irish vehicle, Sovcom Capital DAC. Sovcombank, which grew in recent years after buying the local financial units of General Electric Co., India’s ICICI Bank and Turkey’s Garanti Bank AS, was among banks targeted by sanctions in the early days of the war. It’s been cut off from SWIFT -- a bank messaging system -- and its assets abroad have been frozen. Policymakers at the European Central Bank believe the eurozone faces a period of ‘slowflation’ due to the Ukraine war - less severe than full-blown stagflation. The minutes of their meeting last month, released today, showed that the ECB saw rising prices and slowing growth: While the Russian invasion of Ukraine had increased uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic outlook, related risks to the inflation outlook were seen as largely one-sided, with experience suggesting that wars tended to be inflationary, often fuelled by increased fiscal spending in conjunction with a loose monetary policy stance. While the war would likely dent economic growth in the short term, annual growth was projected to remain positive even in the severe scenario, pointing to “slowflation” rather than stagflation. Belarus has followed Russia and begun paying foreign debts in local currencies, after sanctions over its role in the invasion of Ukraine hampered payments. Bloomberg has the details: The government has been driven to using Belarusian rubles to service loans owed to the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Nordic Investment Bank, it said in a statement on its official Telegram channel. The announcement follows President Alexander Lukashenko’s decree in March authorizing the use of the local currency for debt payments. “This is a forced measure,” the council of ministers said in the statement. “Belarus’ ability to settle its debts in dollars and euros with western creditors is limited because of the sanctions.” On Monday, Russia was unable to pay around $649m to holders of its debt, after the US Treasury banned US banks from processing the payments, due to the freeze on Russia’s foreign exchange reserves. Paying in roubles, rather than dollars, on Russia’s dollar-denominated debt could be classed as a default, if the situation isn’t rectified within 30 days. US central bank policymaker James Bullard has called for a rapid series of interest rate rises, to get US inflation under control. Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, says the Fed’s short term policy rate should reach 3.5% later this year. The rate is currently 0.5%, so that would imply a 50 basis point hike at each of the Fed’s remaining meetings, a very sharp tightning of monetary policy. Reuters has the details: “I would like to get there in the second half of this year...We have to move,” to get ahead of inflation running at triple the Fed’s 2% target, Bullard said. “We are talking about bigger moves than we have made in a long time so there would be management that has to be done.” The pace described is slightly quicker than the one Bullard offered at the March Fed meeting, which saw the federal funds rate reaching as high as 3.25% by year’s end. The minutes of the Fed’s latest meeting, released last night, showed that policymakers were ready to start shrinking their balance sheet from May, unwinding the pandemic stimulus programme. Boris Johnson’s energy security plan has been dismissed as a missed opportunity to bring down bills rapidly, over its failure to fund energy efficiency upgrades or back onshore windfarms in the face of Tory backbench opposition. While the government’s plans set targets for long-term expansion of nuclear, offshore wind and solar capacity, it stopped short of doing so for onshore wind. The proposals also lacked a major intervention to help households lower their gas usage by improving insulation standards. The shadow business and energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said Johnson had been “held to ransom” by backbench opposition to windfarms. Energy experts and environmental groups labelled the plan “inadequate”, warning it would do little to address the urgent need to tackle sky-high bills and reduce dependence on gas imports, including from Russia. The strategy did set ambitious targets for offshore wind generation, with the government raising its target from 40 to 50 gigawatts by 2030. But Johnson did not back a wind industry proposal to double onshore capacity to 30GW over the same period. Traffic on major routes in Kent have been brought to a standstill again today due to delays in Channel crossings. P&amp;O’s shock sacking of 800 workers last month continues to cause disruption, as passengers numbers rise during the Easter getaway. PA Media has the details: A 23-mile coastbound stretch of the M20 was closed from junction eight (Maidstone) to junction 11 (Westenhanger) to store thousands of lorries heading for the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel as part of Operation Brock. This is causing chaos on surrounding local roads. The A20 Roundhill Tunnel is closed under the Dover TAP scheme to prevent HGVs jumping the queue. Delays to Channel crossings are being driven by the suspension of P&amp;O Ferries sailings after the operator sacked nearly 800 seafarers without notice last month. This is putting more strain on other ferry operators amid increased demand as many families travel overseas for Easter holidays. DFDS said P&amp;O Ferries customers will be unable to transfer their bookings onto its Dover-Calais sailings between Friday and Sunday because of a lack of capacity. Operation Brock involves using a moveable barrier to create a contraflow system enabling lorries to queue and other traffic to keep moving in both directions. However, the system has been overwhelmed, with Kent hit by long queues every day since April 1 when poor weather also disrupted crossings. The Port of Dover said in a statement it handled 30,000 departing passengers last weekend, which was a three-fold increase on the total during the corresponding weekend in 2021. It added it is “expecting another busy weekend” as it urged customers not to arrive before their booked sailing. Trevor Bartlett, leader of Dover District Council, said the port will be “under severe pressure throughout the busy Easter getaway” as he warned residents to prepare for “some disruption again this weekend”. He said he has “made it clear” to Kent Police, Kent County Council and the Kent Resilience Forum - a partnership of local organisations and agencies - that “we will not tolerate another weekend of gridlock in Dover”. The Conservative councillor went on: “For too long, local residents and businesses have had to endure disruption and, quite frankly, deserve better. “We share your concerns about the impact of gridlock on local businesses and access to vital health and social care for our most vulnerable residents. “Many are rightly worried about how the emergency services would be able to respond to a major incident when all routes into the town are effectively cut off.” Ashford MP Damien Green called for changes to be made to Operation Brock. He told KentOnline: “What we need is to make Brock work. “We have established that up until now it does work, even in times of stress, because the motorway is kept open. “Once you close the motorway it makes it impossible, so the Kent Resilience Forum needs to look at what changes need to happen so Brock can cope with what is a very unusual situation, where more than half of the freight-carrying capacity at Dover has disappeared in one time.” P&amp;O Ferries announced on Wednesday that it is preparing to resume cross-Channel sailings. A spokesman said: “P&amp;O is looking forward to welcoming back vital services and we expect to have two of our vessels ready to sail on the Dover-Calais route by next week, subject to regulatory sign-off, namely both the Pride of Kent and Spirit of Britain between Dover-Calais.” Here’s Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, on the tumble in US jobless claims to a 50+ year low: The labor market is so tight that layoffs hit a new historical low. In only one other week since records began, in November of 1968, were fewer layoffs recorded. But “tight” depends on perspective, because while employers struggle to hire and retain workers, workers have the confidence to change jobs at a near-record pace, switching most often for higher pay or better working conditions. And for the economy, this means more months of adding around a half million jobs, and that we will hit the pre-pandemic high of Americans employed this summer. The number of Americans signing on for unemployment support has dropped to its lowest level in over half a century. The weekly jobless claims total fell to 166,000 last week, the lowest level since 1968. That suggests that the US jobs market remained solid last week, despite inflationary pressures and worries over the Ukraine war, with firms holding onto staff. That’s below forecasts of around 200,000 new layoffs, and 5,000 fewer ‘initial claims’ than the 171,000 a week before. Continuing claims (people receiving at least their second week of unemployment support) rose to 1.52m, from 1.506m [this data lags the initial claims by a week]. Mark Zuckerberg is looking to develop virtual coins, nicknamed “Zuck bucks” by staff, for users of Facebook and Instagram as part of a suite of products designed to reduce his platforms’ dependence on advertising in the future metaverse. Facebook’s parent group, Meta, is looking to develop a range of virtual products – including digital tokens and “creator coins” – to diversify income and revitalise its user base, which is increasingly turning to newer rivals such as TikTok. While Meta remains the dominant social media network provider – its revenues rose 37% to $118bn in 2021 as advertisers clamoured to reach the 4.9 billion monthly active users of Facebook and Instagram – TikTok has also built up a massive non-ads business based on in-app purchases and e-commerce. Meta, which has proven quick to ape successful products rolled out by rivals such as Snapchat, is now exploring ways to further monetise its user base, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the story. Products being looked at include “social tokens” or “reputation tokens”, which could be used as rewards by users. It is also looking at “creator coins”, which could be used by influencers on Instagram. Here’s our news story on BT’s pay deal: Tesco has also announced a pay rise for staff. Its hourly pay for shop staff and warehouse workers will be increased by 5.8% from £9.55 to £10.10. The supermarket group said the pay increase will come into force from July 24. Jason Tarry, chief executive officer of Tesco UK &amp; ROI, said: “We are delighted to have reached an agreement with Usdaw that recognises the vital role our colleagues play in our business now and in the future, giving them a well-deserved pay rise, more access to extra hours and setting out a long-term commitment and investment in their careers at Tesco. “These investments in our colleagues are central to making Tesco what we truly want it to be: a great place to work for all, a place that attracts and retains the best talent in the industry.” The Usdaw union says the deal is a ‘major step forward’ for its New Deal for Workers campaign which includes aiming to ensure a minimum wage of at least £10 per hour for all workers immediately, ending rip-off youth rates and providing a living wage. Unions had threatened strike action at Tesco last year, after rejecting previous offers. BT is planning to hand its UK frontline workers a £1,500 pay increase, although unions say they have rejected the proposal and are preparing a vote on strike action. The company said the flat rate pay rise is being given to 58,000 workers across BT Group, including engineers, contact centre staff and retail staff. BT said the increase is “focussed on the lowest paid workers” and will work out as a roughly 8% increase for some members of staff [those on under £20,000 per year]. For higher paid frontline workers, it would be a smaller rise (around 3.33% for someone on £45,000, I calculate). BT says the deal “contrasts well with the average of 3% typically being awarded by UK employers.” Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT, said the firm hopes lower paid workers will “benefit most and as soon as possible” amid the rising cost of living crisis. “BT Group has continued to support the country as it recovers from the pandemic: keeping families connected, helping businesses to grow in new, online markets, and supporting organisations to stay connected and adopt hybrid working. “We took the decision not to use redundancy and the Government’s furlough scheme as a direct consequence of the pandemic, and thanks to the contribution of all 100,000 BT people, we’ve continued to improve customer ratings and invest in growing our full-fibre and mobile networks. BT had been in lengthy discussions with unions, who had reportedly opposed a previous offer of £1,200. But with CPI inflation now 6.2%, the Communication Workers Union says it has rejected this latest pay offer, and will prepare for a vote on strike action: Nearly half of UK businesses expect Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to hit their sales in the year ahead, according to a survey from the Bank of England. The BoE’s latest poll of decision makers also found that uncertainty continued to rise, with anxiety over inflation also mounting. Nearly half of respondents (48%) expected the Russia-Ukraine war to negatively impact their year-ahead sales, with the average impact expected to be around -3%. Around 11% of firms said the conflict was their largest current source of uncertainty, and nearly half cited it as a top-three threat. Around 49% of firms said the overall level of uncertainty facing their business was ‘high or very high’, highlighting the anxiety in boardrooms and management meetings. That’s up from 47% a month ago. Uncertainty about future sales growth also increased modestly, and there was a sharper rise in uncertainty about future inflation. Firms are expecting to raise their prices over the next year - expected year-ahead annual output price inflation also rose to 5.0% in the three months to March 2023, the BoE says. The new boss of the Co-op has warned that supply disruption continues to be a “huge challenge” amid shortages of broccoli, lettuce and sunflower oil on the retailer’s shelves. Interim chief executive officer Shirine Khoury-Haq, who will permanently replace Steve Murrells in the top job next month, told the PA news agency that “price rises are a given” as higher supply costs add to an array of inflationary pressures. Allan Leighton, chairman of the group, added that inflation was currently “in the ballpark of 4% to 5%” as the retailer committed to pumping money into keeping key items affordable amid the cost-of-living crisis. The company said it had invested £18m in price reductions over the past year and will hold the price of around 1,000 popular products. Bosses said the business also saw significant cost increases away from its retail business, with inflation in coffin materials affecting its funeral arm. Ms Khoury-Haq said the business has to be prepared for “further volatility” and be well-positioned to react to further supply issues. She said: “These issues are not going to go away any time and it is very multi-faceted so we need to work hard to protect our customers and suppliers. “The supply side of things is still a huge challenge globally. “For example, flooding in Spain has impacted green vegetables like broccoli and lettuce so we have to switch those out in some products. “Similarly, the situation in Ukraine has impacted sunflower oil and that is being replaced by rapeseed oil, so we recognise that things are still changing all the time.” Inflation in Ireland has soared to its highest level in over 20 years. Consumer prices in the Republic jumped by 6.7% in the year to March 2022, the highest annual inflation rate since November 2000 (when it was 7%). Prices jumped by 1.9% in March alone, the largest monthly increase since the monthly CPI series started in 1997. Over the last year, transport costs have jumped 18.7%, while soaring bills have pushed up the “Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas &amp; Other Fuels” costs by 17.4%. Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco were 7% pricier. The report also shows that diesel and petrol prices were both up over 30% in the year to February, even before energy prices jumped again last month. UK businesses are growing increasingly worried about rising energy and commodity prices. The latest analysis of the UK economy, from the Office for National Statistics, shows that rising input costs, and soaring energy bills, are the top two main concerns reported by businesses The ONS says businesses in the food and accomodation sector are particularly anxious about the jump in energy prices: Among specific concerns reported for the next month, energy prices saw the largest percentage point increase between February and March 2022, increasing from 15% in late February 2022 to 20% in late March 2022. The accommodation and food service activities industry reported the largest proportion of businesses noting rising energy prices as their main concern, at 35%. Other main concerns reported by businesses were: input price inflation (inflation of goods and services prices) at 23%, up from 21% in late February 2022 supply chain disruption at 6%, unchanged from late February 2022 taxation at 6%, up from 5% in late February 2022 Bellway, Countryside and Vistry have become the latest UK housing firms to sign up to the UK Government’s fire-safety pledge in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. The trio are joining other housebuilders, including Barratt, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and Crest Nicholson, who also pledged to fix safety problems at building between 11m and 18m high, built in the last 30 years. It follows government pressure on building firms to ensure that leaseholders didn’t pick up the bill. Bellway predicted that works related to the pledge will cost it about £300m, on top of £186.8m set aside since 2017. Jason Honeyman, chief executive of Bellway, said: “The issue of life-critical fire safety defects in apartment schemes is a sector-wide challenge and Bellway has engaged extensively and constructively with DLUHC over recent months, both directly and through the Home Builders Federation (‘HBF’). We have always taken the issue of building safety very seriously and agree with the Government’s principle that residents should not have to fund life-critical fire safety remedial works. Our engagement to date and commitment to continue our responsible approach has resulted in Bellway today making a pledge that schemes constructed by us or on our behalf in the last 30 years will be remediated. This is a positive outcome for affected residents, made in the best long-term interests of the Group and will help to secure our ongoing reputation as a leading responsible homebuilder.” Vistry says meeting the pledge will cost £35m to £50m, in addition to its existing fire safety provision of £25.2m, plus up to £3m of extra administrative costs. Countryside expects it to cost another £24m, on top of £41m provided in 2021 for remedial works on multi-occupancy buildings. The City watchdog is hiring an extra 80 staff to crack down on “problem firms” and protect customers. The Financial Conduct Authority says its new three-year strategy, announced this morning, will include a push to shut down problem firms which do not meet basic regulatory standards. The FCA says the rising cost of living could drive greater demand for credit products (as families struggle to pay soaring bills) and push customers towards new ways to “manage and make more of their money”. It says the new strategy prioritises resources to “prevent serious harm, set higher standards and promote competition”, adding: A key focus of the strategy is shutting down problem firms, which do not meet basic regulatory standards. The FCA is recruiting 80 employees to work on the initiative, which will protect consumers from potential fraud, poor treatment and create a better market. Shell had previously indicated that pulling out of Russia would cost around $3.4bn, Reuters points out. Here’s their take on this morning’s announcement: Shell will write down up to $5bn following its decision to exit Russia, more than previously disclosed, while soaring oil and gas prices boosted trading activities in the first quarter, the company said on Thursday. The post-tax impairments of between $4bn and $5bn in the first quarter will not impact the company’s earnings, Shell said in an update ahead of its earnings announcement on May 5. Shell, whose market capitalisation is around $210bn, had previously said the Russia writedowns would reach around $3.4bn. The increase was due to additional potential impacts around contracts, writedowns of receivables, and credit losses in Russia, a Shell spokesperson said. Shell shares were down 1.2% at the start of London trading. The start of 2022 marked one of the most turbulent periods in decades for the oil and gas industry as Western companies including Shell rapidly pulled out of Russia, severing trading ties and winding down joint ventures following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Shell said it will exit all its Russian operations, including a major liquefied natural gas plant in the Sakhalin peninsula in the eastern flank of the country. More here: Shell raises Russia writedown to as much as $5 billion Back on Shell... the oil giant says this morning: Shell has not renewed longer-term contracts for Russian oil, and will only do so under explicit government direction, but we are legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion. Shell also told the City that there was “unprecedented volatility in commodity prices” in the first quarter of the year. Housing affordability is a growing concern for would-be buyers, says Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor: It is largely dependent on three factors: house prices, household income and mortgage interest rates. All three have been rising, but the two that reduces affordability (house prices and mortgage rates) combined outstrips growth in household income - the area that increases affordability. “Rising house prices means buyers have to save bigger deposits than they did pre-pandemic. The cost-of-living crisis exacerbates matters, eating into disposable income, making it harder to save for a deposit. The likelihood of higher interest rates to combat soaring inflation means that for those looking to buy their first home, it is only going to get tougher. Fast-rising rents are not offering any relief and could keep some wannabe homeowners in the hunt for a home for longer than they would like.” Property agent Emma Fildes of Brickweaver says the search for ‘new beginnings’ lifted average house prices by £43,577 since the first lockdown. Charlotte Nixon, mortgage expert at Quilter, predicts that worries about the Ukraine war, and rising interest rates, will ‘put the brakes’ on runaway house prices. The situation in Ukraine remains unstable and the cost of living crisis is being felt increasingly by the day, particularly as the energy price cap and national insurance increase have both now come into play. Given the increased financial instability, first time buyers and prospective home movers will likely think twice before embarking on the expensive process of buying a new home. “What’s more, the Bank of England is expected to increase interest rates further, which will further reduce people’s spending power. Prior to the outbreak of war in Ukraine, inflation was expected to peak at 7.25%, this is now likely to be considerably higher and the only way to combat it is with increased rates. Should this happen, the already dwindling number of cheap mortgage rates will quickly disappear and monthly costs will see a swift increase. Should less people look to move home as a result, the cost of house prices may finally start to see a slowdown. Shortages of homes will prevent prices falling back this year, suggests Mike Scott, Chief Analyst at estate agency Yopa: There was some expectation of a slowdown in the rate of growth of house prices this year, but it is clear that this has not yet happened. he combination of restricted supply, high demand and interest rates that remain at historically low levels despite the recent base rate increase is continuing to push prices higher. Yopa does expect that the rate of growth will slow down in the second half of the year, as interest rates rise further and cost of living increases start to bite. However we do not anticipate that the market will turn around completely, with prices starting to fall, since it will take more than one year to rebuild the stock of homes for sale to a more normal level. The South West of England has overtaken Wales as the UK’s strongest performer in terms of annual price house inflation. Prices in the South West region jumped 14.6% in the last year, taking average house prices there to a record £298,162, Halifax reports. House prices in Wales have risen 14.1% over the last year, up to a record £211,942. Since the first pandemic lockdown began two years ago, the average UK house price has jumped by an astonishing £43,577, or 18%. Back in March 2020, in the first wave of Covid-19, it was hard to imagine such a house price boom (frankly, who was thinking about house prices anyway?). But the market has proved surprisingly resilient, supported by measures such as the stamp price holiday and the furlough scheme. Demand for larger, more rural, homes in the move to home working and home schooling has also pushed prices higher. Halifax explains: The impact of the pandemic on buyer demand can be seen most clearly when looking at different property types. With a premium now put on those properties offering greater space – both indoors and out – prices for flats have increased by 10.6% or £15,404 over the last two years. Compare this to the average price of a detached property which has leapt by 21.3% or £77,717 over the same period A shortage of properties helped to push up UK house prices by 11% over the last year, says Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax: “The story behind such strong house price inflation remains unchanged: limited supply and strong demand, despite the prospect of increasing pressure on households’ finances. Although there is some recent evidence of more homes coming onto the market, the fundamental issue remains that too many buyers are chasing too few properties. The effect on house prices makes it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers looking to make their first step onto the ladder, but also challenges homemovers who face ever bigger leaps to move up the rungs to a larger property. However, Galley predicts that higher interest rates and inflationary pressures will cool the market: In the long-term we know the performance of the housing market remains inextricably linked to the health of the wider economy. There is no doubt that households face a significant squeeze on real earnings, and the difficulty for policymakers in needing to support the economy yet contain inflation is now even more acute because of the impact of the war in Ukraine. “Buyers are therefore dealing with the prospect of higher interest rates and a higher cost of living. With affordability metrics already extremely stretched, these factors should lead to a slowdown in house price inflation over the next year.” UK house prices continued to surge last month, lifting the average house price to a new record high over £282,000. But, the cost of living squeeze could take some heat out of the market this year. Mortgage lender Halifax reports that house prices grew by 1.4% month-on-month in March, the biggest rise in six months, after a 0.8% rise in February. It’s the ninth consecutive month of increases in a row, and means house prices were 11.0% higher than in March 2021. Here are the key points: Monthly house price growth of 1.4% the biggest increase for six months Average property price reaches another new record high of £282,753 Two years on from the first lockdown, house prices have now risen by £43,577 South West overtakes Wales as UK area with strongest house price inflation Cost of living pressure likely to slow the rate of house price growth this year Good morning, and welcome to our live rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Quitting Russia is set to cost oil giant Shell up to $5bn, but the surge in oil prices will cushion the blow. Shell reported this morning that it will write off between $4bn and $5bn (£3bn-£3.8bn) post-tax in asset values after deciding to exit Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. The bill covers the “impairment of non-current assets” and additional charges such as writing down debts owed by customers and credit losses. Last month, Shell announced it would withdraw from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons, including crude oil, petroleum products, gas and liquefied natural gas, stop importing Russian crude oil, and shut its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia. But, Shell has also reported that its oil and gas trading activities will get a boost from soaring energy prices, which jumped after the Ukraine war began. It says that earnings from oil trading are expected to be “significantly higher” in the first quarter of 2022 than in the fourth quarter of 2021. The indicative refining margin is around $10.23/bbl, compared to $6.55/bbl in the fourth quarter 2021. Trading at its integrated gas division are also expected to be stronger than in the previous quarter. Shell’s update comes as the UK government announces its long-awaited energy strategy to cut the country’s reliance on overseas energy. Nuclear energy is at the heart of the strategy, with plans for up to eight new reactors, and a goal to lift offshore wind power capacity to make 95 per cent of the country’s electricity “low carbon” by 2030. But there’s disappointment that ministers have vowed to continue the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas, and not announced plans to cut demand through a push on insulation. As our news story explains: The plans risk infuriating environmental campaigners, after the opportunity to remove barriers to more onshore wind farms appeared to fall victim to Tory in-fighting, new North Sea drilling won the government’s blessing, and ministers appeared to open the door to fracking. Opposition parties were scathing about the strategy. Two former energy secretaries from Labour and the Liberal Democrats branded it “ludicrous” and “hopeless” for failing to expand onshore wind power or tackle energy efficiency.

Nuclear powers are on a deadly path to more conflict,2022-04-07T17:15:06Z,Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pbe,"Truly, the human race has a death wish.

Yet even more expenditure is planned on the means of death and destruction (Aukus pact extended to development of hypersonic weapons, 5 April). In January, the five primary nuclear weapon powers, the US, Russia, France, China and the UK, made a joint statement, echoing the original declaration by Reagan and Gorbachev in 1985, that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”. Just months later, the response to the carnage in Ukraine, and the threat to use nuclear weapons, is not to draw back from the precipice, but to accelerate the drive to the cliff edge.

"Police failed woman who killed herself in Blackburn cell, inquest finds",2022-04-07T17:10:10Z,Helen Pidd North of England editor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pe3,"Police officers failed a vulnerable and suicidal woman after arresting her and putting her in a police cell where she killed herself, an inquest jury has found. Kelly Hartigan-Burns, 35, died in December 2016 after she was treated with “reckless indifference”, campaigners say, by police in Blackburn. She had been arrested after members of the public spotted her late at night walking in and out of traffic in her pyjamas saying she wanted to die. Her family fought for an inquest to be held, believing she was failed by Lancashire constabulary at every level, from the control room to the response on the street, in her home and at the police station. A jury at Preston coroner’s court agreed, concluding that “if officers had shown more compassion, acted diligently, practised common sense, followed guidance and procedure from the moment they found Kelly and throughout her detention, there may have been a different outcome”. The jury gave an open conclusion, with a narrative detailing a litany of failures that they said contributed to her death. In October 2021 a finding of gross misconduct was made against Jason Marsden, the custody sergeant involved in Hartigan-Burns’s case, barring him from returning to work for the police. After the arrest late on 3 December 2016, police officers took Hartigan-Burns home to her partner, Cal, who was a mental health nurse. Cal warned police that she was a suicide risk, and police incident logs showed five separate mental health incidents involving Hartigan-Burns in the previous year. But instead of using their powers in mental health cases to take Hartigan-Burns to a place of safety, police arrested her for common assault arising from an argument she had had with Cal that evening. No consideration was made of her mental health history when she was put in a cell with no CCTV, and she was left on her own when the custody sergeant left two hours early without checking on her. His colleagues did not check either until she was found unresponsive in the cell and was taken to hospital where she died. June Hartigan, Kelly’s mother, said: “For the last five years we have been tortured by what we knew must have happened, by all the things the police did wrong, and all the ways in which Kelly might have been saved. While it helps to hear that the jury could see the same level of wrongdoing, the fact it has taken five years to reach this stage means this is something of a hollow victory.” Deborah Coles, the director of the campaign group Inquest, said: “Kelly was a woman in mental health crisis, in need of care and specialist support, not custody. Police officers treated her distress, vulnerability and suicide risk with reckless indifference.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

‘We’re going to shake up the status quo’: cryptocurrency group take over Crawley,2022-04-07T17:08:57Z,Paul MacInnes,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ptd,"Crawley Town have been taken over by a group of cryptocurrency investors who are promising to bring “Web3’s most innovative ideas” to the League Two club. Wagmi United, a US consortium who had previously been linked with a deal to buy Bradford City, confirmed their revolution in West Sussex after taking a controlling stake in Crawley from the Turkish steel magnate Ziya Eren. Crawley are currently mid-table in English football’s fourth tier and their most recent set of accounts revealed the club to be half a million pounds in debt. But the new owners, backed by funding from prominent US internet entrepreneurs, have ambitions for promotion and promise to increase fan engagement through digital tokens. “Crawley Town Football Club is a club with more than 125 years of rich history that we revere and respect,” said Preston Johnson, one of Wagmi United’s founders. “However, a conventional approach to ownership hasn’t worked, and the club is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds while fans suffer through year after year of uninspiring results on the pitch. “We think the club can do better and our fans deserve better. Sports are supposed to be fun and bring communities together. At Crawley Town, we’re going to shake up the status quo, try out some new ideas, and build a worldwide community of fans.” Johnson and his fellow Wagmi founder Eben Smith are both enthusiasts for NFTs – digital tokens that are increasingly ubiquitous in sport but have been controversial due to speculative trading in their value. It appears Wagmi’s plan is to sell NFTs that will allow buyers to take decisions in the club while also generating revenue. Smith has cited one possible use of the NFTs to be the opportunity for fans to remove him as a club director should Crawley not be promoted to League One in two years. “We might run for reelection,” Smith said, “but we don’t just get to hold the fanbase hostage because our dad invented Cablevision.” Cablevision was an American television provider that went out of business in 2016."
Akshata Murty’s non-dom status is totally legal – and perfectly toxic for Rishi Sunak,2022-04-07T16:57:43Z,Gaby Hinsliff,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p7k,"Rishi Sunak sounded every inch the gallant, protective husband. His wife, Akshata Murty, hadn’t asked to be in the public eye, the chancellor told the BBC plaintively, and he had found it “very upsetting” when she was targeted. Her money was her money, and the stake she held in the multibillion-pound family business Infosys – which was then still doing brisk trade in Moscow even as Sunak exhorted companies to cut ties with Russia – was strictly her affair, not his. After all, isn’t every woman entitled to a professional life independent from her husband’s? The chancellor even wryly compared himself to the actor Will Smith, who lashed out at the comedian Chris Rock after the latter joked about his wife’s hair, as if being reportedly richer than the Queen was just Akshata’s rotten luck too. Only now it turns out there’s another, somewhat less endearing theory for why the chancellor might be anxious to move on from the subject of her fortune, and it’s that she doesn’t pay British tax on a chunk of it. Taxes are rising for millions of Britons this month, but in the Sunak household, well, maybe not so much. For Murty has been revealed as a non-dom: she pays British taxes on any earnings in this country but not on any income overseas, a perfectly legal choice but one that could conceivably have saved the Sunak household a tidy sum. And, to be clear, it is a choice, much as her husband’s decision not to uprate benefits this month in line with unexpectedly soaring inflation was a choice. Murty retains Indian citizenship. That’s something she has every right to do, just as Nick Clegg’s wife, Miriam, had every right to remain a proud Spanish citizen when he was in government. But tax experts argue that the chancellor’s wife could have opted to pay tax in the country where her husband sets it. That she didn’t is, arguably, not surprising: in the circles in which she moves, it might seem crazy to risk the family inheritance just to spare a husband’s political blushes. What really is astonishing, however, is that the chancellor seemingly imagined he could keep all this private, even while hiking taxes on people with nowhere to run from them. There are few more damaging charges in politics than “one rule for them, another for the rest of us”, as Boris Johnson so helpfully demonstrated by presiding over a regime that repeatedly broke its own Covid rules. Yet his supposed heir apparent has just walked straight into the same elephant trap. Plenty of Conservative voters can cope with a leader who is cheerfully and unashamedly rolling in it, even in the middle of a crippling squeeze on living standards. Just look at the way they have indulged Jacob Rees-Mogg down the years. Nor should it prove impossible for a rich politician to govern well for the poor, given some capacity for human empathy and – call me a hopeless old romantic – the existence of data. Politicians who actually listen to the evidence in front of them and choose advisers capable of filling in their blind spots can and often do transcend their own narrow personal experiences; for anyone aspiring to lead a whole country, that’s literally the job description. But what all voters can smell a mile off is politicians trying to pass themselves off as what they’re not, and Sunak’s everyman act is now wearing decidedly thin. Borrowing a suitably humble-looking hatchback off a supermarket worker instead of using one of his own more luxurious cars for a post-budget photo opportunity at the petrol pumps was clumsy but understandable, given that chancellors normally travel courtesy of a government driver. But failing to clarify his wife’s tax arrangements in public, awkward as that might make dinner with the in-laws, is in a different league. Non-dom status was a major political dividing line at the 2015 election, and Ed Miliband threatened to scrap it if Labour won. Scrapping or restricting it has been at least a theoretical option for Sunak, too, at every budget or spring statement he has delivered. How long did the chancellor imagine he could avoid disclosing this very personal interest in public? What else do we not know about his wife’s finances? And without full disclosure, how can we be sure his family circumstances aren’t shaping his decisions, even subconsciously? For Sunak, all this is hideously toxic. So toxic, indeed, that he could be forgiven for wondering where the constant drip, drip, drip of damaging information about his gilded lifestyle – the £335 trainers in which he was recently photographed, the £100,000 personal donation the Sunak-Murtys have made to his old public school – could be coming from, as the Metropolitan police’s Partygate inquiry wends its way inexorably towards the prime minister’s door. The single biggest deterrent for despairing Tory MPs agonising over whether to trigger a leadership election is the fear of detonating something whose outcome they can’t control or predict. If Sunak no longer looks like a sure thing, a reliable plan B likely to be accepted across the party, then putting in a letter to the 1922 committee becomes an altogether wilder roll of the dice. But the truth is that whatever dark arts are being practised in dark corners, Sunak’s star has been quietly waning for a while. The chancellor’s job is to say no, but the Treasury’s tightfistedness at a time of huge demands on the state evidently grates on some colleagues. In the absence of a clear Tory agenda driven by the prime minister, Sunak hasn’t noticeably seized the opportunity to create one. His biggest remaining asset was his air of general wholesomeness, a sense that in contrast to his chaotic neighbour here was a devoted family man with no skeletons in his closets or wild, Covid-defying parties in his basement, and with sound political judgment to boot. But in failing to go on the front foot over what was always going to be the tricky issue of his family’s wealth, the chancellor has effectively dented his own brand. Faintly mad as this sounds, it now looks more likely than it did that Johnson will lead this government into the next election; that the greased piglet, in David Cameron’s immortal phrase, will wriggle free, if only because his party has run out of better ideas. If it all goes pear-shaped, Sunak will doubtless have other options. What a shame the rest of the country can’t say the same. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"
Joe Lycett: sites such as Airbnb and eBay must do more to stop scams,2022-04-07T16:46:55Z,Rachel Hall,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p95,"Platforms that connect buyers and sellers such as Airbnb and eBay must do more to protect consumers from scams, according to the comedian and TV presenter Joe Lycett, who accused them of pocketing the revenue but refusing to take responsibility for fraud. The presenter of Channel 4 consumer rights show Joe Lycett’s Got Your Back told peers that regulation, including the introduction of more rigorous checks, should pressure lucrative social media and sales platforms into helping customers who regularly lose thousands of pounds in transactions with fake sellers . Speaking to the House of Lords digital fraud committee, he said: “I think the biggest sector that we think could do better are the platforms. “These platforms are often making a lot of money … they should be obliged to do more in that area.” He described the typical response from platforms as: “Well, it’s kind of nothing to do with us, we’ve just offered the platform on which you meet and find these businesses, but if you get scammed it’s nothing to do with us.” Lycett said his TV show’s team had set up a fake account for the chief executive of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, and a fraudulent listing for the Airbnb offices in London. “They didn’t check and they didn’t stop it. We turned up with the paperwork, and they didn’t like to see us, didn’t let us in,” he said. He also criticised banks for failing to protect consumers from increasingly sophisticated scams, citing the example of one woman who lost thousands of pounds after scammers texted her from NatWest’s official phone number, meaning messages arrived within an existing thread with her bank, a scam also replicated in phone calls from legitimate numbers. “[NatWest’s] argument was, ‘We can’t stop people pretending to be something they’re not because they were very sophisticated in how they did it,’” he said. Many banks have signed up to a voluntary code that reimburses blameless victims who are tricked into transferring money, but critics say this is applied inconsistently. Lycett said: “It is kind of at [the banks’] discretion whether they refund their customers who have been scammed.” He added it was a “little bit too easy” to open a bank account without too many questions being asked, and that personal data was widely available online to buy for as little as 20p. Lycett also told peers his TV programme would never have been commissioned if Channel 4 had not existed, because most commercial broadcasters would consider it too risky from a legal perspective. Asked what he had been most surprised by in the three years since the show started, he said the volume and sophistication of scams, with the cases that appear on the show representing a tiny fraction of the stories the producers receive. He added that although the stereotypical scammed victim was an older person less familiar with modern technology, in reality rates were much higher for younger people aged 16 to 34. Complex romantic scams in which victims are groomed over a period of months, such as the fraud depicted in the Netflix series The Tinder Swindler, are also on the rise, he said. Lycett said it was crucial that more was done to stop scammers – who often operate abroad and are difficult for police to track down and prosecute – because fraud “absolutely ruins people’s lives”."
Players could face European bans if clubs breach new Uefa financial rules,2022-04-07T16:35:04Z,Paul MacInnes,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pfe,"Individual players could be banned from playing in Champions League fixtures as punishment for breaching new financial sustainability measures, Uefa has confirmed. A replacement for financial fair play (FFP) rules was approved by Uefa’s executive committee on Thursday, and will be brought in this summer, with clubs in continental competition ultimately limited to spending no more than 70% of their revenue on players, transfers and agents fees. Sanctions for breaking the rules range from fines and point deductions to player and competition bans, but officials admit the changes will not be enough in themselves to redress competitive imbalance in Europe. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said the regulations had been agreed after more than 100 meetings with football stakeholders. “I am very happy, I don’t want to say even surprised, that we got support from all the stakeholders,” he said. “Uefa’s first financial regulations … helped pull European football’s finances back on track. But the football industry changed and alongside the inevitable financial effects of the pandemic, it has shown the need [for] reform.” Under the new rules, clubs taking part in European competition (and by extension clubs who hope to qualify in future) must comply with three different criteria regarding solvency, stability and cost control. Solvency measures will ensure that all payables owed are paid on time, with quarterly inspections. Under stability rules, clubs could lose up to €60m (£50m) over three years, but losses must eventually be covered by owner investment. Finally, cost controls would limit the money spent on players and coaches. Uefa will also monitor all sponsorship deals struck by clubs to ensure they are conducted at fair market value. Punishments for breaking the regulations depend on the size of breach and whether it persists. For smaller, shorter breaches, financial fines will come into place. Larger longer breaches could result in “prohibition on registering new players in Uefa competitions”, as well as limits on squad sizes. Uefa’s financial sustainability director Andrea Traverso said the possibility of relegating offenders, from the Champions League Europa League or Europa Conference League, was also being considered. “If a rich club overspends above the cap it will incur sanctions,” Traverso said, arguing that new rules would be tougher to circumvent. “There might be various ways to circumvent, to disguise payments of salary, but it [would] breach national law as well as Uefa regulations. Our capacity to investigate is limited, we are not the police, but we believe that in the way they are defined it is becoming more and more difficult to get around.” Traverso was forced to acknowledge, however, that the rules would not achieve greater competitiveness in European football. “Competitive imbalance cannot be addressed simply by financial regulations,” he conceded. “It must be addressed in combination with sporting measures and other measures. This is why we changed the name. The name fair play was interpreted as creating a level playing field, we wanted to change [that perception].”"
Serena Williams hints she will make return to tennis at Wimbledon,2022-04-07T16:29:04Z,Tom Lutz,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pg7,"Serena Williams has hinted that she will make her return to tennis at this year’s Wimbledon. The 23-time grand slam champion has not played professionally since last year’s Wimbledon, where she withdrew early in her first-round match against Aliaksandra Sasnovich due to a hamstring injury. The injury also caused her to miss the US Open, and she chose not to travel to the Tokyo Olympics. She did not play at this year’s Australian Open after saying she was not happy with her level of fitness. However, in an Instagram story with NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers on Thursday the 40-year-old suggested she will compete at Wimbledon this summer. “We’ve been talking about my comeback and he’s been hyping me up and getting me ready for Wimbledon. Can’t wait!” When Rodgers asked her if she would play at this year’s US Open Williams said: “Wimbledon’s before the US Open, I’ve got to play Wimbledon first. Exciting!” Williams is chasing Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam singles titles. Her last one came at the 2017 Australian Open and she lost in the finals of the US Open and Wimbledon in 2018 and 2019. This year’s Wimbledon runs from 27 June to 10 July. She has won the grass court tournament seven times, her most recent success coming in 2016 when she defeated Angelique Kerber in the final. Williams is currently ranked 246 in the world. Earlier on Thursday, Williams’s long-time coach Patrick Mouratoglou said he is now working with Simona Halep. “Today I am starting a new chapter in my coaching career – I am now the full-time coach of Simona Halep,” Mouratoglou said in a statement on Twitter. “In the last eight months, I realised how much I missed coaching. It is the passion of my life and I still feel like I have so much to give. “Simona came to the Mouratoglou Academy before Indian Wells for a training block. I swung by at a few of her practices, watched her train. “At the end of the week, she asked me if I was available to coach her. I have the highest respect for her but it was out of the question at the time. A few weeks later, I had a conversation with Serena, and the door opened for me, at least short-term, to work with someone else. I will keep you updated on what’s coming next soon.”"
P&O Ferries owner DP World loses status as partner in Solent freeport,2022-04-07T16:12:34Z,Richard Partington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zfc,"The Dubai-based owner of P&amp;O Ferries has lost its status as a formal partner in one of the government’s biggest freeport projects, after widespread public anger over the firing without notice of 800 workers last month. Ministers have confirmed that DP World, the Emirati logistics giant behind P&amp;O, no longer had a central role as a “partner” in the Solent freeport after the resignation of its UK commercial director from the scheme’s board last week. It comes after questions in the Lords from the Green party peer Natalie Bennett who had asked the government what plans were being put in place to withdraw any freeport contracts as a result of the sackings. Speaking for the government, Stephen Greenhalgh, a levelling up minister, responded on Wednesday night saying: “On 28 March 2022 DP World resigned from the Solent freeport board and are no longer a partner in the freeport consortium.” The government has come under heavy pressure for its handling of employment rights and the role of DP World in critical UK infrastructure after P&amp;O Ferries fired 800 crew members without consultation last month. The firm’s boss admitted to MPs the company broke the law on giving notice because “no union could accept our proposals”. Last month the Guardian reported that DP World was in line to benefit from at least £50m of UK taxpayer support as part of its key role in the Solent and Thames freeports, leading to questions in parliament from Labour party leader Keir Starmer over the government’s priorities. The funding of £25m per freeport, which is still subject to approval, will be paid to a lead local authority responsible for each of the 12 special tax and customs zones across the UK and is expected to be spent to benefit the entire freeport region. DP World is the operator of the freight container terminal at the Port of Southampton, a part of the Solent freeport. However, it is more heavily involved as a partner in the Thames scheme, where it owns and runs the London Gateway port and logistics park which was designated as one of the government’s freeport tax sites last year. Greenhalgh appeared to suggest in the Lords that the company still had a role as a partner in the Thames project. “The government is continuing to work to understand whether DP World or P&amp;O Ferrymasters are in breach of any of the requirements on them as investors in the Thames freeport,” he told Bennett. Last week DP World’s UK commercial director, Aart Hille Ris Lambers, quit the Solent freeport board amid local pressure, including from Portsmouth council leader Gerald Vernon-Jackson, another of the 11 members on the Solent freeport board. However, details of the end of the company’s role as a partner were not confirmed at the time. Alan Whitehead, the Labour MP for Southampton Test, whose constituency includes the freeport, said it was appropriate that DP World no longer had a formal role on the steering body given its track record on employment rights. “It’s right that they take more of a back seat now. I don’t think it’s just the resignation of a director, the freeport consortium has decided that, and certainly that has my support,” he said. DP World is still the operator of the port of Southampton, an integral part of the Solent freeport as the second-biggest container terminal in the UK. Covering a broad area including the cities of Southampton, Portsmouth and most of the Isle of Wight, the Solent freeport is expected to create 32,000 jobs while adding £3.6bn to the UK economy by boosting international trade. “They’re not about to flee the port or anything, they’ll continue to operate the container terminal. But the freeport develops without their lead involvement. Among other things that’s a better guarantee that the terms and conditions in the freeport are likely to be better respected,” Whitehead said. The government also said last week that Ernst Schulze, chief executive of DP World UK, was no longer part of the government’s post-Brexit trade advisory group created to support global business opportunities. DP World has been approached for comment."
"Of course Rishi Sunak’s wife is a non-dom. For the Tories, hyper-wealth is normal",2022-04-07T16:12:25Z,Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zkj,"Who is shocked? “Outrage over huge pay rises for Manchester Airports Group bosses” was a Guardian story on Wednesday, just as the airport seized up. Those eight-hour queues of passengers were partly caused by the company’s mass redundancies; almost 900 jobs were lost at the airport group during the pandemic. No wonder it now has trouble recruiting, after the remaining staff took a 10% pay cut to help the company through Covid. Yet in that same crisis moment, executives had grasped themselves huge pay rises of almost 25%. The chief executive was awarded a £500,000 rise, taking his total pay to £2.5m. This is just one of the many stories from the boardroom troughs that have filled the business pages over the last decades, as fat cats have plundered the companies they manage while average wages have stood still. Here’s the question: is Britain so habituated to decades of kleptocracy that voters just cynically shrug this off, the way they do in Russia? The lid blew off top pay in the 1980s, and since then many of these masters of the universe have been severely undertaxed, according to a report on Wednesday from the IFS. A corrupted tax system allows those who register their income through their own companies to pay just 27% tax, by classing their earnings as “capital gains”: as employees, these high earners should be paying an average 42%, the IFS says. This deceit looks glaringly worse in a week where ordinary employees have been hit with the national insurance levy. Other types of incomes – whether capital gains, share dividends, professional law partnerships or landlords’ rents – doesn’t pay any NI contributions, and is taxed lower than earned income. Taxes on unearned wealth can fall to as low as 10% for the “business asset disposal relief” wheeze, or even zero when capital gains owed to the Treasury are mysteriously wiped out upon death. The one sensible thing Margaret Thatcher’s chancellor Nigel Lawson did was to tax all income at the same level, whatever its source, removing any incentive to distort earnings by shunting them through elaborate self-employment and company structures. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has proposed a similar policy. The government’s own creation, the Office of Tax Simplification, recommended aligning income tax and capital gains rates in 2020. So why did the Treasury shelve this measure? The only reason can be to please the very rich. These aren’t just the party’s donors, but the Conservatives’ social and political milieu. They make hyper-wealth seem normal and all attacks on it a danger to “enterprise”. The IFS firmly slaps down that idea. Helen Miller, the deputy director of the IFS and a co-author of the report, writes that “preferential rates on business income” change how people take their income, “but are not well targeted at promoting entrepreneurship”.” Rishi Sunak is in trouble over disclosure that his wife – whose annual income is £11.5m – is a non-dom quite legally paying no UK tax on the money she earns abroad. This illuminates a stratosphere of wealth far beyond the imaginings of most taxpayers. If Sunak never heard the klaxon about what this might look like, it reveals just how little he understands the lives of most people he is now subjecting to the harshest cost of living shock in living memory, let alone the poorest people who are well below his radar. A massive £100,000 donation Sunak recently made to his old school, Winchester college, displays a similarly alarming insouciance about the state schools he starves of resources, whose teachers earn 8% less than a decade ago. Of course, a plutocrat could be chancellor – all MPs are in the top 10% of earners – but to be a credible politician, it takes 10 times the social sensitivity of this fiscally conservative belt-tightener. The governor of the Bank of England displayed this same social idiocy when he called on workers but not boardrooms to show “restraint in pay bargaining, otherwise it will get out of control” even as real pay is falling yet faster after a decade of pay stagnation. The top 1% tend to defend themselves and their tax privileges with an angry retort that they pay 28% of all the nation’s total income tax and national insurance collected, so everyone else should be truly grateful to them and so should the Treasury. What’s more, the share of total income tax and NI they contribute is rising: they were responsible for only 20% collected in 2003-4. Well, of course it’s rising, because their earnings flew ever higher above everyone else’s since then, so they pay a bigger share. The gap between rich and poor has widened to the largest in more than a decade. The ONS said the income inequality gap as measured by the Gini coefficient had “steadily increased to 36.3%”, which was “the highest level of income inequality since 2010”. Is Britain now shockproof, too used to these familiar tales of greed at the top to react? Many, myself included, thought that the crash of 2008, when bankers’ risk-taking was bailed out by taxpayers, would mark the moment the public no longer tolerated unmerited, undertaxed rewards. But no. Until now, pay stagnation has been a slow frog-boiler. But this time, as food and energy bills arrive like Exocets landing on ordinary households, forcing immediate family spending cuts, not just for those in poverty but for people who are more comfortably off, too, the spectacle of boardroom greed and pandemic profiteering may ignite public indignation. If so, Sunak will become an increasingly uncomfortable figurehead for the Tories. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"
Rabid red fox that bit nine on Capitol Hill caught and euthanized,2022-04-07T16:10:55Z,Maya Yang,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ped,"Health officials in Washington DC have euthanized a red fox that was responsible for biting at least nine people on Capitol Hill, including a congressman, and which tested positive for rabies. The female fox was captured on Tuesday and by Wednesday, officials from the DC health department confirmed that she had been “humanely euthanized” so she could be tested for rabies. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an animal has to be euthanized in order to be tested for rabies as a brain sample needs to be extracted. “The DC Public Health Lab has confirmed the fox that was captured … tested positive for the rabies virus,” officials said in a statement. They also urged anyone who had come in contact with the fox to contact health officials, who are also “contacting all human victims who were bitten by the fox”. In a statement to NPR, a police spokesperson said, “[We] just learned people have seen foxes before, but this recent aggressive behavior is unusual,” adding that the fox was seen around the Dirksen Senate office building, the Russell Senate office building, and the House area of the Capitol. Health officials also found the fox’s offspring – known as kits – on Capitol Hill and are considering what to do with them. Among the people bitten is Representative Ami Bera, a Democrat from California who reported that he was bitten by a fox on Monday evening. He has since received seven shots, including five shots of immunoglobulin around the ankle where it bit him, one in either side of the buttocks, as well as a tetanus shot in the shoulder and a rabies shot in his arm. On Wednesday, Bera said he feels “healthy” and is “glad to be back at work”. Ximena Bustillo, a Politico journalist, was also bitten by the fox. On Tuesday, Bustillo tweeted: “That feel when you get bit by a fox leaving Capitol cause that’s of course something I expect in THE MIDDLE OF DC.” Bustillo said she was not contacted by health officials about the positive rabies test before they made the public announcement, the New York Times reported. DC health officials said they would “not be doing a roundup of healthy foxes in the area” and that the health agency “only intervenes to remove wildlife if they are sick or injured or where an exposure to humans has occurred and rabies testing would be warranted”. Since news of the Capitol Hill fox emerged, people were quick to comment on social media. One user tweeted, “The first honest thing on The Hill in 60 years, and they kill it. Rest in power, Comrade Fox.” “I’m guessing the fox is not the only thing rabid on Capitol Hill,” someone else wrote."
"UK politics: Sunak should explain wife’s non-domicile tax decision, says Labour – as it happened",2022-04-07T08:15:06Z,Nicola Slawson,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7njv,"Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day: Rishi Sunak’s multi-millionaire wife claims non-domicile status, it has emerged, which allows her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. Akshata Murty, who receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in the Indian IT services company Infosys, declares non-dom status, a scheme that allows people to avoid tax on foreign earnings. Several leading international tax experts have disputed Akshata Murty’s claim that must be treated as a non-dom for UK tax because she is an Indian citizen, saying tax domicile status is a choice and not connected with a person’s nationality. Those resident in the UK do not have to have a British passport in order to pay British taxes, meaning Murty could have paid UK tax at any time. Labour has called for clarity and “complete transparency” over why Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, uses non-domicile status. Keir Starmer, asked about Rishi Sunak’s wife holding non-domiciled status, said: “If it now transpires that his wife has been using schemes to reduce her own tax then I’m afraid that is breathtaking hypocrisy.” Rishi Sunak’s wife pays £30,000 a year to secure her non-domiciled tax status, her spokesperson has confirmed and accepted it was possible that Akshata Murty uses the status to take advantage of tax havens for income earned outside the UK. As political pressure increased on the chancellor and his spouse, the spokesperson said Murty had no plans to say where she pays tax on overseas income as that information was not “relevant”. The business secretary has admitted that the government’s energy security strategy will do little to help alleviate soaring fuel bills now. Kwasi Kwarteng said that it’s “more of a medium three, four, five year answer” ahead of its reveal later today. Keir Starmer said the government’s energy strategy “won’t help those who only last week saw their energy bills go up by hundreds of pounds”. What people wanted from the government was a response that met that challenge, he said. Boris Johnson said “nuclear is coming home” as a result of the government’s energy strategy. In a social media video to promote the plan, which was finally released today after repeated delays and cabinet wrangling, the prime minister said: “We’ve got the ambition, we’ve got the plan and we are going to bring clean, affordable secure power to the people for generations to come.” Rishi Sunak vetoed plans to ease the cost of living crisis for millions of households after proposals to more than double the energy bill rebate scheme were rejected, according to a document leaked to the i paper. The UK government has confirmed that no new nuclear power stations will be built in Scotland, as the Holyrood government – which is opposed to nuclear energy – dismissed new plans to install eight reactors at existing sites as “risky and expensive”. Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed there were “no plans to impose nuclear reactors in Scotland” in future. Ed Miliband said the government should ban transgender conversion therapy. He said: “Trans people face incredible barriers and stigma in our society” and that the debate on trans issues was “really awful” for many trans people. That’s it from me today. Thanks for joining me. For the latest news on Ukraine, follow our dedicated live blog: Rishi Sunak’s wife pays £30,000 a year to secure her non-domiciled tax status, her spokesperson has confirmed and accepted it was possible that Akshata Murty uses the status to take advantage of tax havens for income earned outside the UK. As political pressure increased on the chancellor and his spouse, the spokesperson said Murty had no plans to say where she pays tax on overseas income as that information was not “relevant”. The spokesperson declined to elaborate on the initial explanation for Murty’s non-dom tax status – the fact she has Indian citizenship – when this would still mean such a tax arrangement was a choice. They accepted it was possible that Murty’s arrangements meant she minimised her tax using tax havens. They said no further details would be given, other than to say that Murty abided by all necessary rules. Labour called for clarity over her tax arrangements, while Keir Starmer said it would be “breathtaking hypocrisy” if she had been reducing her liabilities while the chancellor was raising taxes on others. There was also concern from some Conservative MPs, with one former minister saying the revelation was particularly unfortunate on the day the national insurance rise came into force. The perception is, what is the problem? Here is someone worth £3bn who has a different tax arrangement. I’m sure everything is above board but that’s not the point. Murty receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from a stake in her family’s IT business empire, Infosys, which is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and listed on the Indian and New York stock exchanges. Under UK tax laws, Murty’s status as a non-dom means she does not have to pay tax on dividend payments from overseas companies. UK resident taxpayers currently pay up to 39.35% tax on foreign dividend payouts. It is not known where she pays tax on this overseas income. It previously emerged that Murty is a shareholder in a restaurant business that funnelled investments through the tax haven of Mauritius. Asked where Murty paid tax on her overseas income, a spokesperson said Murty had no plans to comment on this because it “doesn’t seem relevant”. Read more from my colleagues Peter Walker, Jessica Elgot, Aubrey Allegretti and Rupert Neate here: This is the government form that the chancellor’s wife Akshata Murty will have filled in to apply for non-domiciled status in order to avoid paying UK tax on tens of millions in dividends collected from her family’s Indian IT business empire. When it was revealed on Wednesday that Murty was a non-dom, and therebynot required to pay UK tax on about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in Infosys, her spokeswoman said Murty “is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes” suggesting that she had no control over her UK tax status. However, all UK residents must actively apply for non-dom status by filing in government tax form SA109 to claim the tax relief. Murty’s spokeswoman suggested that because Murty was an Indian citizen she cannot also hold UK citizenship and therefore must be treated as a non-dom for UK tax. Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents’ home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income. However, several leading international tax experts have disputed this and said tax domicile status is not connected with a person’s nationality. Those resident in the UK do not have to have a British passport in order to pay British taxes, meaning Murty could have paid UK tax at any time. Richard Murphy, a professor of accounting at Sheffield University management school and tax justice campaigner, said: Domicile has nothing to do with a person’s nationality. Nor does it have anything to do with not being able to have a British passport because a person holds citizenship from another country. And non-domiciled status is certainly never given for that reason. Murphy said non-dom status is only given to people who applied for it. In that case the implication in Ms Murty’s statement that she has to be treated as non-domiciled is simply wrong. She is only non-domiciled because she asked to be so. She can also give up the claim to be non-domiciled at any time,Just because she was non-domiciled when she arrived in the UK as a newly married person does not mean she has to keep the status now. So the fact she’s still non-dom is also a choice. Arun Advani, assistant professor at the University of Warwick’s economics department and an expert on non-dom tax law, said: “Citizenship has nothing to do with whether you choose to/not to claim remittance basis in the UK.” Read the full story here: Rishi Sunak vetoed plans to ease the cost of living crisis for millions of households after proposals to more than double the energy bill rebate scheme were rejected, according to a document leaked to Richard Vaughan and Paul Waugh at the i paper. The i reports: An earlier draft of the energy security strategy drawn up by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng’s department and obtained by i included measures to increase the £200 energy rebate to “£500 or more” for either all households or just “fuel poor” homes. But the policy recommendation was rejected by the Treasury, despite growing fears within government over damage soaring energy bills would have on household budgets. An alternative suggestion was to delay the repayment of the energy rebate or to extend the repayment period for either all households or the poorest was also dismissed. So too was a policy proposal to exempt the poorest homes from having to repay the rebate. Read the full story here. Boris Johnson’s new energy strategy could take up to five years to start shaving money off people’s bills, the business secretary has admitted, as the prime minister announced a drastic expansion of nuclear reactors. Kwasi Kwarteng said the plan for cutting reliance on imported energy in response to soaring prices caused in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was more of a medium-term way to increase homegrown energy production. Johnson declared that the long-delayed energy security strategy meant “nuclear is coming home” – but the review declined to set targets for onshore wind and committed to continuing the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. Days after 22 million people were hit by the energy price cap rising by 54%, Kwarteng suggested it would be years until the benefits of the strategy would be felt by consumers. The business secretary told Sky News: The strategy is more of a medium-term three, four, five-year answer. I think it’s really important that we get an energy strategy that means we can have more security and independence in the years ahead. We want to have security of supply, we want to live in a world where we’re not dependent on what Russian policy is, but we have more control over energy sources here in Britain. The cost of offshore wind had decreased enormously in the past 10 years, Kwarteng said, adding: Some of these benefits can happen quite quickly. But we need to start the planning process and the strategy now. And that’s what this security strategy is all about. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, attempted to intervene in the cost of living crisis at the end of March, but was accused of not doing enough to help struggling households expected to face the biggest fall in living standards since modern records began in the 1950s. Read the full story here: The “cold hand of the chancellor” should not prevent the government from investing more in insulating homes in the UK, ministers have been told. The crossbench peer Lady Hayman questioned whether reluctance from the Treasury was responsible for the lack of action on insulating homes in early information from the government’s energy strategy. The strategy was published today as western countries wrestle with high prices and how to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas, and in the face of calls to end the fossil fuel era to tackle dangerous climate change. In the Lords, Hayman – a former minister – criticised early information from the strategy, released yesterday. She said: What has been published is in the week of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s most frightening warnings yet on global warming and when customers and consumers face horrifying energy bills. It is deeply dispiriting to see a set of policies outlined that concentrate on the expensive and the long-term and fail to support what would work immediately and help both consumers and the climate. Why are there no extra measures to support consumers in insulating their homes? We have some of the worst housing stock in the world and it is an absolute no-brainer to reduce demand and to support. Is that the result of the cold hand of the chancellor? The business minister Lord Callanan said the government was “already spending a lot of money on energy efficiency programmes”. He also said: We are rolling out the development and the formation of low carbon sources of power, be it nuclear, be it offshore wind and we are going to go further on onshore wind. I know it is a subject she feels passionately about. We must do so in full recognition of the concerns of many local communities so we want to take people with us – when we do that we will be seeking a number of pilots to take those policies forward. Labour has called for clarity over why Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, uses non-domicile status, as Keir Starmer said it would be “breathtaking hypocrisy” if she had been reducing her tax liabilities while the chancellor was raising taxes on others. Murty receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from a stake in her family’s IT business empire, Infosys. Under UK tax laws, Murty’s status as a non-dom means she would not have to pay tax on dividend payments from overseas companies. Infosys is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and listed on the Indian and New York stock exchanges. UK resident taxpayers pay a 38.1% tax on dividend payouts. After her status was revealed by the Independent a spokesperson for Murty said that because she was a citizen of India, which does not allow Indians to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously, she “is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”. They added: “She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.” However, tax experts have said non-dom status is not automatic but a choice. Prof Richard Murphy, a Sheffield University academic who co-founded the Tax Justice Network, said: Domicile has nothing to do with a person’s nationality. In other words, the claims made in the statement issued by Ms Murty are wrong, and as evidence, just because a person has Indian citizenship will never automatically grant them non-dom status in the UK. The Labour MP Chris Bryant said the statement needed to be clarified: This is just wrong. Non-dom status is not automatic and the Treasury needs to urgently clarify this inaccurate statement. After shutting down legitimate questions about Infosys and its operations in Russia last week, it’s time for Rishi Sunak to come clean. Starmer said Sunak “has very, very serious questions to answer”. Read more from my colleagues Peter Walker and Aubrey Allegretti here: Keir Starmer, asked about Rishi Sunak’s wife holding non-domiciled status, told broadcasters: A chancellor who says to the British public that he will tax them – he’s introduced 15 tax rises, and he says all of this is necessary, there’s no option – if it now transpires that his wife has been using schemes to reduce her own tax then I’m afraid that is breathtaking hypocrisy, and it shows yet again that we have got a chancellor who is completely out of touch with the struggles that so many people in this country are going through at the moment with this cost-of-living crisis. Asked if Akshata Murty should change her tax status, Starmer added: We need complete transparency on this so that we can all understand what schemes she may have been using to reduce her own tax. But to use a scheme when the Chancellor is out there day after day saying we need tax rises on millions of people in this country who are really, really struggling is breathtaking hypocrisy. More than one in 10 residents of some of London’s wealthiest neighbourhoods have claimed “non-dom” status at some point, meaning they paid no tax on their offshore income. UK-based people who have benefited from this special tax status by claiming another country as their legal “domicile” made up more than 12% of residents in two parliamentary constituencies in 2018 – Kensington, and the Cities of London and Westminster, according to an analysis of HM Revenue and Customs data. In five of the most affluent council wards they accounted for more than a quarter of residents. The study by the London School of Economics and the University of Warwick found that the number of people who had ever claimed non-dom status in the UK rose from 162,000 in 2001 to 238,000 in 2018. The findings were published after it emerged that Akshata Murty, the wife of Rishi Sunak, claims non-dom status, which would allow her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. The study found that more than 93% of non-doms were born abroad, coming mainly from the US, India – of which Murty is a citizen – and western Europe, especially France, Germany and Italy, the study found. The number of Indian non-doms has risen most rapidly, from about 4% of the total in 2001 (3,200) to almost 14% in 2018 (22,700). Read the full story here: The UK government has confirmed that no new nuclear power stations will be built in Scotland, as the Holyrood government – which is opposed to nuclear energy – dismissed new plans to install eight reactors at existing sites as “risky and expensive”. The Scottish government’s energy secretary Michael Matheson told BBC Radio Scotland this morning: Not only is there environmental risk associated with that, there is also the issue that this is likely to drive up the cost of household bills - whereas renewables such as wind and marine tidal in the future would actually reduce the cost of electricity. I think the UK government might have allowed themselves to be wrapped up in the nuclear lobby here. His UK counterpart Kwasi Kwarteng said there were “no plans to impose nuclear reactors in Scotland” in future. The UK government plans also proposed a new licensing round for oil and gas projects in the North Sea – but Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously said that ramping up North Sea oil and gas is not a short-term solution to Europe’s reliance on Russian supplies. Keir Starmer said the government’s energy strategy “won’t help those who only last week saw their energy bills go up by hundreds of pounds”. What they want from the government is a response that meets that challenge, he said. The Labour leader told broadcasters that “because of political squabbling it leaves out of account really important initiatives like keeping homes warm, insulating homes, which I’ve seen for myself can make a huge difference and reduce bills by up to 400, that’s the sort of real action we were looking for today”. Asked if the strategy will help the UK achieve energy security, he said: Anything that makes us less reliant on importing our energy is a good thing, which is why I didn’t think the prime minister was doing the right thing by saying we’re going to stop our reliance on Russia, but then go to Saudi Arabia. But anything that keeps our supply in Britain is a good thing because we do need a secure energy supply. Speaking about what Labour would do, Starmer said: What we’ve been calling for a number of years now is turbo-charging on renewables, including onshore wind turbines, fast-forwarding nuclear, that should have happened over the last decade and it hasn’t happened, there’s been a real failure there, developing on hydrogen, but also very importantly insulating our homes so that we reduce our energy intake and reduce bills for people. Because at the moment I think the thing that most people are worried about is how on earth they are going to pay their energy bills, and we need real answers to that question right now. Labour leader Keir Starmer said the energy strategy was “not enough” and “too little, it’s too late” to help families with rising costs. Asked if the measures will be enough to help those struggling, Starmer told broadcasters: No, these measures are not enough. Only last week we saw energy bills going up in the middle of a very real cost-of-living crisis which is causing people real hardship. All we’ve got today is a cobbled-together list of things that could and should have been done over the last 10 to 12 years and it doesn’t even tackle really important things like insulating homes, which could save 400 on everybody’s bill. So it isn’t enough, it’s too little, it’s too late. The Liberal Democrats said plans to build new nuclear reactors could add £96 a year to household energy bills and would be an “energy betrayal”. The added cost would come about if each household paid an additional £12 a year for eight new reactors, the party said. The party’s leader Ed Davey said: People are facing eye-watering hikes to energy bills and are looking to the government for urgent help now. But instead of rapidly reducing energy costs by expanding onshore wind and insulating homes, the government’s nuclear plans will add almost 100 to annual household bills. This is an energy betrayal that will add to the pain facing households on the brink. Instead of offering the help families need, the Conservatives seem happy for people’s record energy bills to get even higher. The UK Green Building Council (UKGBC), the progressive voice of over 650 organisations working together for a more sustainable built environment, has criticised the government’s lack of new energy efficiency measures in the energy security strategy, saying it was a missed opportunity. UKGBC’s director of communications, policy and places, Simon McWhirter said: Today was a chance to insulate the nation’s homes, protect us against future price hikes and tackle the painful effects of rising energy costs to households across the UK. This should have been the moment to show leadership and set out a comprehensive strategy to reduce energy demand. But despite the building industry standing ready to rise to the challenge, the Government has woefully missed its opportunity. He added: In the week the world’s climate scientists name energy efficiency as one of the most significant lower-cost solutions to address the climate crisis, the prime minister hasn’t even got a plan to stop heat leaking out of the windows, walls and roofs of the UK’s 29 million homes. Boris Johnson said measures to help people with bills in the short term will come from other government policies, rather than the newly unveiled energy strategy. The strategy has been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing energy demand through measures such as insulating homes. Speaking during a visit to the Hinkley Point C power plant, the prime minister said: This is a long-term energy security strategy, this is about supply, this is about undoing the mistakes of the past and taking the big decisions now. What we are also doing is looking after people who need to retrofit their homes, who need to put in lagging, who need to insulate their boilers - there is a 6 billion energy efficiency fund that we are already using to deliver very substantial savings to people. There is a 5,000 grant you can get if you want to change your boiler, we are also looking to see what we can do to champion heat pumps so they are made in this country rather than elsewhere, and we are setting up a 30 million ‘accelerator fund’ to do that. UK businesses are growing increasingly worried about rising energy and commodity prices. The latest analysis of the UK economy, from the Office for National Statistics, shows that rising input costs, and soaring energy bills, are the top two main concerns reported by businesses The ONS says businesses in the food and accommodation sector are particularly anxious about the jump in energy prices: Among specific concerns reported for the next month, energy prices saw the largest percentage point increase between February and March 2022, increasing from 15% in late February 2022 to 20% in late March 2022. The accommodation and food service activities industry reported the largest proportion of businesses noting rising energy prices as their main concern, at 35%. Other main concerns reported by businesses were: input price inflation (inflation of goods and services prices) at 23%, up from 21% in late February 2022 supply chain disruption at 6%, unchanged from late February 2022 taxation at 6%, up from 5% in late February 2022 For more business stories, you can follow our business liveblog here: The chairman of the commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee said the strategy was a “missed opportunity” to help households struggling with their bills. Labour MP Darren Jones said: For families and businesses across the country energy security means being able to turn the heating or electricity on knowing you can afford to pay the bill. Ministers continue to ignore the reality faced by of millions of people with yet another missed opportunity to help bill payers and a failure to announce funding for the home insulation works required to reduce the amount of heating needed in the first place. Replacing gas power with more nuclear power is lower carbon, but nuclear isn’t renewable and it isn’t cheap. It’s disappointing that the government has failed to seize the full opportunity of onshore wind and solar once again with no explanation other than disagreements within the Conservative party. Speaking at Hinkley Point C, Boris Johnson denied that the government was doing nothing to help families in the short-term, saying: We are really doing a huge amount for the immediate cost of living. This (energy strategy) is about tackling the mistakes of the past and making sure that we are set well for the future and we are never again subject to the vagaries of the global oil and gas prices and we can’t be subject to blackmail, as it were, from people such as Vladimir Putin, we have energy security here in the UK. It is a massive strategy for delivering 50GW – almost half the total energy capacity of this country – from offshore wind by 2030, totally reviving the nuclear industry which, I am afraid, has been more or less moribund in this country. This is the home of nuclear energy - we first split the atom in the UK, we had the first civilian nuclear power plant, we are bringing nuclear home. A former minister should be suspended from the Lords for a week for bullying a parliamentary security officer, a standards watchdog has recommended. The Lords conduct committee recommended that Labour’s Lord Pendry should receive the punishment following an incident in July 2021, PA News reports. The peer confronted a security guard who had found one of his guests walking unescorted near the Lords chamber in the Palace of Westminster. A report by Lords standards commissioner Akbar Khan found that Lord Pendry was “verbally aggressive” to the security guard and showed “intimidating behaviour”. Lord Pendry denied a claim he grabbed the guard’s radio, but the guard and a witness both described physical contact “in an inappropriate, unwarranted and non-socially distanced manner”. The House of Lords will be asked to agree the report and punishment early in the new session. Almost 3,000 Covid-19 deaths have been added to the UK’s official figures after the discovery of a data error. The cumulative number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus rose by an extra 2,714 on Wednesday, in addition to 233 newly reported deaths. It means the total number of deaths in the UK within 28 days of a positive test is 169,095. The UK Health Security Agency said: Due to a data processing error, a number of people who died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were not reported in a timely manner. The 2,714 deaths, all of which occurred in England this year, were added retrospectively to the government’s coronavirus dashboard on Wednesday evening. The revision to the figures narrows the gap slightly between the government’s preferred death toll, based only on people who have died within 28 days of testing positive, and the number of people who have had Covid-19 recorded on their death certificate, which is published by the Office for National Statistics and stands at just over 190,000. Both measures of Covid-19 mortality have shown a slight increase in recent weeks in the number of deaths occurring each day in the UK, reflecting the impact of the surge of infections driven by the Omicron variant. The daily death toll remains well below levels reached during the first and second waves of the virus. Boris Johnson said energy bills had been going up around the world and “absolutely soared” after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “We just can’t carry on like this,” the prime minister said in a social media video promoting his new energy strategy. The plan has been criticised for not saying enough about tackling high bills now, instead focusing on longer-term shifts in energy generation. Johnson said the plan would make British energy “cleaner, more affordable and more secure”. As well as the already announced £9bn package to help with rising costs, the government would “bring those bills downs” by “upgrading homes so they use less energy”. Ending dependence on foreign oil and gas would make supply more secure, he said, with a shift to British fossil fuels during the transition to cleaner forms of energy. That would involve “capturing their emissions and storing them safely under the sea”, he said – but carbon capture projects have been promised by successive governments without any real progress. Ed Miliband said the government should ban transgender conversion therapy. Speaking to Sky News, he said: I think there are strong views on lots of sides here but I’ll give you my perspective on this. I think that trans people face incredible barriers and stigma in our society. I was talking to a trans person the other day about this. I think the way this debate has been conducted – these anatomical debates – I think it is really awful for so many trans people in our country. Asked if transgender conversion therapy should be banned, he said “Yes”. He also spoke about transgender women taking part in female sport, saying there needs to be “fairness” and not a blanket ban. He said: I think that is a decision for the sporting bodies though ... I think it’s different in different sports. I think the principle here is that we need fairness in sport. Kwasi Kwarteng insisted chancellor Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, has not been “sheltering” herself from paying UK tax. He told BBC Breakfast: I was very interested in the transparency, it was very clear to me what’s happened. I think the chancellor has been very honest, very clear, and she’s after all a private citizen, she’s not a politician, and I think her affairs were completely transparent, and there’s no hint of any wrongdoing at all. So, I think everything is in order in that way. Asked if she was sheltering herself from tax, Kwarteng said: I don’t think that’s true at all, sheltering sounds as if you’re evading things. I think she’s been very clear, she’s been very transparent, the chancellor’s been very transparent, and this non-dom status has been part of the UK tax system for more than 200 years. Ed Miliband said Rishi Sunak’s wife claiming non-dom status is “legal, but is it right?” Speaking to Sky News, the shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, said: Non-dom status is legal but I think we should be clear that non-dom status is used to... pay less tax than you otherwise would. You don’t have to be a non-dom. You choose to do it... I think there are legitimate questions that need to be asked of Rishi Sunak about this. Asked if the move is above board, he said: I think it’s legal, but is it right? He also added that the Chancellor should issue an “explanation” about his wife’s decision. He is the UK chancellor asking people to pay more in taxes. Is it right that his immediate family is sheltering from UK taxes? I think Rishi Sunak and his family should reflect on that. Rishi Sunak’s multi-millionaire wife claims non-domicile status, it has emerged, which allows her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. Akshata Murthy, who receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in the Indian IT services company Infosys, declares non-dom status, a scheme that allows people to avoid tax on foreign earnings. Murthy, the daughter of Infosys’s billionaire founder, owns a 0.93% stake in the tech firm worth approximately £690m. The company’s most recent accounts suggest that Murthy’s stake would have yielded her £11.6m in dividend payments in the last tax year. Under UK tax laws, Murthy’s status as a non-dom would mean she would not have had to pay tax on the dividend payment from overseas companies. Infosys is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and listed on the Indian and New York stock exchange. By contrast, UK resident taxpayers pay a 38.1% tax on dividend payouts. A spokeswoman for Murthy said: Akshata Murthy is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents’ home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murthy is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income. The Treasury declined to comment. It comes a day after it was revealed that Sunak and Murthy donated more than £100,000 to the chancellor’s old private school, Winchester College. It is understood that Sunak, the chancellor, declared his wife’s tax status to the Cabinet Office when he became a minister in 2018, and he had also made the Treasury “aware, so as to manage any potential conflicts”. Tulip Siddiq, the shadow economic secretary to the treasury, said: The chancellor has imposed tax hike after tax hike on the British people. It is staggering that – at the same time – his family may have been benefiting from tax reduction schemes. This is yet another example of the Tories thinking it is one rule for them, another for everyone else. Rishi Sunak must now urgently explain how much he and his family have saved on their own tax bill at the same time he was putting taxes up for millions of working families and choosing to leave them £2,620 a year worse off. Read more here: Boris Johnson said “nuclear is coming home” as a result of the government’s energy strategy. In a social media video to promote the plan, which is finally being released on Thursday after repeated delays and cabinet wrangling, the prime minister said: In the country that was the first to split the atom, the first truly to harness its power to light our homes and drive our factories, we will once again lead the way. Nuclear is coming home. So instead of a new reactor every decade we will have a new reactor every year. For years, governments have dodged the big decisions on energy, but not this one. We’ve got the ambition, we’ve got the plan and we are going to bring clean, affordable secure power to the people for generations to come. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said it was “completely unfair” to scrutinise the tax affairs of the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s non-domiciled wife, Akshata Murty. He told Sky News: It’s completely unfair to be bringing someone who is not a politician and essentially attacking them in a way that’s happening. She made it very clear that as an Indian national she can’t have dual citizenship and she’s got non-dom status here in the UK. Now, after 15 years staying here she will be domiciled, but for the moment she pays tax on UK income, as I understand, and on foreign income she pays tax outside the UK – that’s what non-domiciled status means. But I’m not here to comment on her tax affairs. He added: I’m totally comfortable with people having businesses, people operating what they do as private citizens, I’m completely comfortable about that. I’m not an expert on her financial arrangements but I think absolutely people have a right to pursue their own business arrangements. I’ve just come here to say very clearly that I think her tax affairs are a matter for her. A former chief executive of Ofgem said the government’s energy security strategy does little to solve the cost-of-living crisis now and fails to improve the efficiency of homes. Dermot Nolan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Frankly it’s not something that’s that radically new and different. The disturbing thing to say at a time of rising energy prices is that there’s very little that can be done in the short run. Most of these decisions will take a long time to have an impact and in the short run we will continue to be dependent on fossil fuels and the prices that consumers are going to pay will still depend on the price of gas. One failure, that could’ve helped in the short to medium run, is a lack of focus on energy efficiency, on insulation, on improving the quality of people’s homes – I think that is an opportunity missed. Ed Miliband has said that a few Tory backbenchers have been “holding the government’s energy policy to ransom”. Speaking to the BBC, Labour’s shadow climate change and net zero secretary said: Onshore wind is the cheapest, quickest form of energy we can get. It’s been blocked since 2015 because of government rules, not because of the views of the population ... but because a few Tory backbenchers are holding the government’s energy policy to ransom ... and people are paying higher bills as a result. Ministers have promised cleaner and more affordable energy to be made in the UK, aiming to make 95% of electricity low carbon by 2030. Miliband added: The government wanted to have a target to double onshore wind ... that is the equivalent of building five new nuclear power stations between now and 2030. I’m in favour of new nuclear but stations that the government is talking about today won’t be built for at least a decade. That’s why this strategy is so deeply flawed. The business secretary has admitted that the government’s energy security strategy will do little to help alleviate soaring fuel bills now, adding that it’s “more of a medium three, four, five year answer” ahead of its reveal later today. Pressed on the impact it will have on energy bills now, Kwasi Kwarteng told Sky News: You are right to say that the strategy is more of a medium term, three, four or five-year answer, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t address this. It’s really important that we get an energy strategy, an energy policy, that means we can have more security and independence in the year ahead. Kwarteng was asked if his department are deprioritising targets to reduce the climate crisis, which he dismissed: I think that the net zero legislation is, after all, in law, we’re focused on that. But, of course, given what’s happening around the world, given the pressure on energy prices, we’re also doing lots of other things to make sure we get energy independence back into the UK.

Texas governor’s plans to bus migrants to Capitol met with bipartisan criticism,2022-04-07T16:03:16Z,Oliver Laughland,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p5p,"Plans announced by Texas governor Greg Abbott that attempt to send undocumented migrants away from the southern border on buses to Washington were met with bipartisan criticism on Wednesday. Abbott, a Republican, told reporters that the state would respond to the Biden administration’s decision to rescind a hardline Trump-era immigration policy by placing state troopers in riot gear at the border and then putting migrants on buses bound for DC. But shortly after his press conference announcing the new policy, the governor issued a release that significantly softened the plan, clarifying that any transportation out of the state would be done voluntarily and only after an individual had been processed by the Department of Homeland security for release into the US. The plans also includes measures to begin “enhanced safety inspections” of commercial vehicles coming across the Texas border with Mexico, which the governor acknowledged would “dramatically slow” traffic at the border. The botched announcement came after the Biden administration last week said it would rescind Title 42 restrictions at the southern border. The policy, introduced by the Trump administration, allowed border officials the power to remove undocumented migrants under public health guidance before they could claim asylum. 1.7 million people had been removed from the US under the program, the majority under the Biden administration. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] announced the policy would end on 23 May as the White House plans for an increase in irregular arrivals at the border. On Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans condemned Abbott’s announcement. Beto O’Rourke, the former Democratic US congressman, who is running for Texas governor this year as Abbott faces re-election, described the announcement as a “political stunt”. “If Abbott focused on solutions instead of stunts, then Texas could have made some real progress on this issue over the last seven years,” O’Rourke said in a statement. In a statement reported by the Texas Tribune, ACLU of Texas staff attorney Kate Huddleston said: “Any forcible busing of migrants across the country would be outrageous and blatantly unconstitutional. Given that Abbott cannot dictate where people are sent, he has already backpedaled on this heinous plan, announcing that it will be only voluntary.” Meanwhile, Texas Republican state representative Matt Schaefer called the announcement “a gimmick” in a post on social media."
Talking Horses: Mister Coffey can take Topham Trophy for Nicky Henderson,2022-04-07T15:53:57Z,Greg Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p6f,"Nicky Henderson’s quest to win the Grand National will go on for another year at least after his remaining entry in this year’s race came out at the overnight stage on Thursday, but he will have high hopes of a seventh win over the National fences at the Festival meeting when Mister Coffey (4.05) goes to post for Friday’s Topham Trophy. This race has been a trickier puzzle for punters than the National in recent seasons, with no winning favourite since 2008, but Mister Coffey has obvious claims after a luckless run in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir at Cheltenham last month. The seven-year-old was badly hampered at the second fence, giving away plenty of ground before launching a strong challenge from off the pace in a race when most of the principals were prominent throughout. Friday’s race is over a much shorter trip but Mister Coffey had enough speed to finish second in a Grade One over two-and-a-half miles in February and has more scope for improvement than most of his rivals. Aintree 2.20: Jonbon’s unbeaten record succumbed to one of the great Festival performances of recent decades when he finished 22 lengths behind his stable companion, Constitution Hill, at Cheltenham last month. It is difficult to believe Willie Mullins’s El Fabiolo has been hiding a similar talent in his three low-key starts so Henderson’s runner should have little trouble adding a Grade One hurdle to his record before heading over fences next season. Aintree 2.55: A small field for this Grade One novice chase but all four runners have a top-level win to their name and the top three in the betting are closely matched on form. L’Homme Presse was three-and-a-half lengths in front of Ahoy Senor at Cheltenham, but likely favourite Bravemansgame was a late scratch there after the ground went against him and has a chance to set the record straight now. Paul Nicholls’s seven-year-old has not put a foot wrong this season and should arguably be favourite, rather than the narrow second-choice, on the balance of his form. Aintree 3.30: Fakir D’Oudairies was backed down to favouritism for this race last year and duly put up a career-best performance to land his first Grade One in Britain. This looks like a slightly weaker renewal and Joseph O’Brien’s chaser will take all the beating. He arrived on the back of a close second in the Ryanair 12 months ago but skipped the Festival this time around and proved at Clonmel in November he can produce his best form after a break. Aintree 4.40: Skytastic’s stamina needs to be taken on trust but he found plenty to extend his unbeaten record on heavy ground at Ascot in February and is an interesting bet at around 6-1 to cap a breakthrough season for Sam Thomas with a first Grade One win."
British sovereignty over the Falklands is an absurd imperial hangover that must end,2022-04-07T15:53:41Z,Simon Jenkins,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zbb,"This April is the 40th anniversary of the start of the Falklands war. Less well known is that it is the 41st anniversary of a final attempt by the British government to concede sovereignty over the islands to the enemy in that war, Argentina. Negotiations in New York were in progress, aimed at securing self-government for the islands under a long lease from Argentina. Had they succeeded, it could have avoided war, resolved an archaic imperial dispute, and brought the islanders peace with their neighbours. This was not to be. The talks ran into opposition both on the islands and on the Tory backbenches in London. At the same time a belligerent military regime under General Galtieri seized power in Buenos Aires and had other ideas. In April 1982, the regime took the islands by force, only to be driven from them by a British taskforce two months later. No peace deal was reached and the Falklands became an embattled fortress in the South Atlantic, with troops, jets and warships on permanent station. The war cost Britain about £2.8bn (£9.5bn in present value) and the islands’ defence costs upwards of £60m annually. In 2012 it was estimated that British taxpayers paid more than £20,000 per islander for defence alone, and approximately one-third of the population worked for the government. Unlike other former colonies such as Gibraltar, relations with the nearest nation-state are thin. Though living in a technically autonomous British overseas territory, the islanders are wholly dependent on Britain. The pre-invasion talks in New York were under the UN’s decolonisation auspices and had been continuing on and off since the 1960s. A high-point in relations had been reached in 1971 with a communications deal negotiated by a talented British diplomat, David Scott. This opened a seaplane link to Argentina, with access to tourists, hospitals, schools and trade. The intention on both sides was gradually to normalise relations prior to a more formal deal. Initially it worked. Islanders took up scholarships at mainland schools and hundreds of Argentinian tourists visited Port Stanley. The confidence did not last. A cheeseparing London objected to the cost of administering the islands and to building an airfield. Argentina lurched into a bellicose neo-Peronist period. There were rows over passports, Argentinian “landings” took place on outer islands, and renewed talks on sovereignty were demanded. These fell to a junior minister in the Callaghan government, Ted Rowlands. Working intensely with the islanders, he in 1977 persuaded them that some compromise was needed, such as a concession of sovereignty to Argentina in exchange for a 99-year or longer leaseback to Britain. There was talk of an additional security guarantee. Rowlands won the islanders’ trust. This initiative was lost with the fall of the Labour government in 1979. Thatcher’s junior minister Nicholas Ridley took over the Falklands brief but lacked Rowlands’ tact. There was by now intense pressure from the Treasury for cuts. A defence review and plans to withdraw HMS Endurance from its South Atlantic patrol suggested to Argentina that Britain was losing interest in the area. Ridley was still set on a deal, but encountered resistance from the fierce pro-islander lobby in parliament. Thatcher was not averse to sovereignty transfer, but was adamant that nothing be done without islander consent. Talks continued, but unknown to either side was that the navy in Buenos Aires was already planning an invasion, “plan Goa”, named after India’s annexation of Portuguese Goa in 1961. This was planned for June, mid-winter in the South Atlantic, but was pre-empted by naval units exploiting the occupation of the neighbouring South Georgia islands by a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants. Fearing a British response, Buenos Aires gambled on a full invasion. Had it held out until June, it is most unlikely Britain would have risked a winter war. At no point in this saga was there any sign from London that Britain was desperate to hang on to the Falklands. The cost was enormous and the dispute was blighting relations with a then resurgent South America. The curse was Thatcher’s grant of a veto to the islanders, who were strongly supported by many in the Tory party, over any agreement with Argentina. After the war, the UN in November 1982 ordered the “decolonisation” talks in New York to resume. They did not and have not done so for 40 years. When in 2013 Buenos Aires did try to reopen negotiations with David Cameron, he hardly dared venture a reply beyond repeating Thatcher’s islander veto. This was to be expressed in their presence at the table in any meeting between Britain and Argentina. Any idea of progress was hopeless: to the Tories, the Falklands had become a monument to the Thatcher era and all it stood for. Last week, the Argentinian foreign minister, Santiago Cafiero, complained in the Guardian that Britain had been negotiating over Falklands sovereignty for 16 years before the war. Now, 40 years on, both countries were behaving “as if the conflict took place yesterday”. Could Britain not get over the hostility? Could the two countries, both now democracies, not get back at least to the Falklands communication agreements of the 1970s? The way London raises the issue of self-determination is something of a red herring. The islanders are not autonomous, for they depend on Britain’s goodwill for their security. Britain effectively disposed of Aden, Diego Garcia and Hong Kong when it suited the national interest. The islanders were persuaded by Scott and Rowlands of the need for compromise. This was almost achieved. Britain won the war, but now finds itself having to sustain a military base in the South Atlantic, while all Argentina has to do is smirk. The solution of leaseback sought by Rowlands, Ridley and others honours geography, history, diplomacy and economics. It is common sense. More than £60m a year on military defence for the islands is not. If London’s politicians lack the guts to seek a deal with Buenos Aires, perhaps the islanders should face the future and seek one for themselves.

PM criticised for failing to push onshore wind or subsidise home insulation ,2022-04-07T12:27:19Z,Rob Davies,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z9g,"Boris Johnson’s energy security plan has been labelled a missed opportunity to bring down bills rapidly over its failure to fund energy efficiency upgrades or back onshore windfarms in the face of Tory backbench opposition. While the government’s plans set targets for long-term expansion of nuclear, offshore wind and solar capacity, it stopped short of doing so for onshore wind. The proposals also lacked a major intervention to help households lower their gas usage by improving insulation standards. The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said Johnson had been “held to ransom” by backbench opposition to windfarms. Energy experts and environmental groups labelled the plan “inadequate”, warning it would do little to address the urgent need to tackle sky-high bills and reduce dependence on gas imports, including from Russia. The strategy did set ambitious targets for offshore wind generation, with the government raising its target from 40 to 50 gigawatts by 2030. A leaked early draft of the energy plan proposed increasing onshore wind capacity from 15GW to 45GW but the target, first reported by the i newspaper, disappeared from the final edit. Energy executives are understood to have told the prime minister during a meeting last week that onshore turbines offered the cheapest and fastest way to wean the UK off gas, the price of which has rocketed further since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the government scrapped its initial target, apparently in response to fierce opposition from senior Tories including the chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who called the turbines an “eyesore”. Instead, the government promised to offer a “limited” number of communities guaranteed lower electricity bills in exchange for supporting local windfarms. Miliband said this would do little to unblock planning restrictions that he said place a “unique burden” on onshore wind, which he claimed could have replaced Russian gas imports within 24 months. Under a moratorium implemented by David Cameron’s government in 2015, onshore windfarms in England require unanimous consent from local communities, meaning they can easily be blocked. “If one person objects, it doesn’t get built,” Miliband told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding that it was easier to build an incinerator or a road in the face of local opposition. “The government has rejected the cheapest, lowest cost, most secure forms of power we have … including onshore wind.” Mark Worcester of the Turley planning consultancy said: “Some of the more immediate opportunities appear to have been missed.” Once an onshore windfarm has secured a contract to supply energy, it can be fully operational within about two years, compared with four or five for offshore projects, according to the trade body RenewableUK. Electricity from onshore wind is also about 20% cheaper than offshore, which is in turn cheaper than nuclear or gas. Miliband accused the government of shying away from onshore “not because of the national interest but because some Tory backbenchers said they didn’t want it to happen”. The energy security plan also came in for criticism for failing to map out a return to nationwide home energy efficiency upgrades, which have dwindled dramatically over the past decade. Since 2013, successive government cuts to support for insulation have reduced the number of installations from 2.3m to 10% of that number, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, an independent advisory organisation. But the energy security plan contained no new measures to accelerate efficiency efforts, amid a row over cost between the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy. One Whitehall source said the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, had been keen to use about £300m in departmental underspend from the past few years to kickstart a programme of mass home insulations. But the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, with whom Kwarteng has previously clashed over financial support for businesses, is understood to have preferred not to commit funding to the plan. The climate thinktank E3G said the gaps in the energy security plan meant that little had been done to address consumers’ energy costs or abandon fossil fuels, including gas and oil imported from Russia. “This isn’t an energy security strategy and will do nothing to bring down energy bills. It is a national security threat and the person who will be happiest with it is Vladimir Putin.” Robert Colvile, head of the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, said the government had not “taken the opportunity to promote demand-side energy efficiency, including via insulation – which in turn will help reduce the most significant costs and support the push for net zero”. Greenpeace said the plans were “completely inadequate”, while the Association for Renewable Energy &amp; Clean Technology said the government had “failed to rise to the challenge facing the country”."
Ukraine tells Nato: Donbas battle will be like second world war,2022-04-07T11:34:41Z,Jon Henley Europe correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zxf,"Kyiv has called for more heavy weaponry from its western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow, saying the scale of any impending Russian assault on eastern Ukraine would remind Nato members of the second world war. “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late, and many people will die,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told a meeting of his counterparts in the alliance in Brussels on Thursday. Kuleba said he expected Nato members to send Kyiv the weapons it needed, including air defence systems, artillery, armoured vehicles and jets, but insisted they must act fast while Moscow refocuses its offensive on the Donbas region. “I have no doubts that Ukraine will have weapons necessary to fight,” he said. “The question is the timeline. The battle for Donbas will remind you of the second world war with large operations, thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.” The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters the alliance had agreed to strengthen support to Ukraine, was providing “a wide range” of weapon systems, and would also provide cybersecurity assistance and equipment to protect against chemical and biological threats. He said there was no sign the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intended to pull back. “We have no indications he has changed his overall goal, and that is to control Ukraine and to achieve significant military victories on the battleground,” he said “What we see is Russian regrouping and repositioning. We expect a big battle in Donbas. We are prepared for the long haul. This war may last for weeks, but also months, and possibly also for years. And therefore we need to prepare for a lot more.” In a rare admission that Ukraine had already inflicted considerable damage on Russia’s invading forces, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov admitted in an interview with Sky News that Moscow had suffered “significant losses” since the start of the invasion, adding: “It’s a huge tragedy for us”. He did not specify a casualty toll. With peace talks between Russia and Ukraine continuing by video, Turkey, which has hosted two meetings between the sides, said images of what appeared to be deliberate civilian killings in Bucha and towns in the Kyiv area had “overshadowed” negotiations and ruined an “emerging positive atmosphere”. Pictures and video of dead civilians, some with their hands bound, in the streets of Bucha after it was recaptured from Russian invaders have sparked international revulsion and renewed calls from Ukraine for more weapons and tougher sanctions. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday that Kyiv had presented Moscow with a draft peace deal containing “unacceptable” elements and deviated from previously agreed proposals, but Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, dismissed the comments as “purely propagandistic” and aimed at diverting attention from events in Bucha. A day after a new round of western sanctions was announced, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said they did not go far enough and that Russia would see them as “permission to attack”. Some politicians were still “unable to decide how to limit the flow of … oil euros to Russia so as not to put their economies at risk”, he said. The west must “bring Russia to justice”, Zelenskiy told the Greek parliament, and teach Moscow that “those who blackmail Europe with an economic and energy crisis always lose”. Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, said sanctions “must be ruinous enough for us to end this terrible war”. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc should approve its fifth round of economic sanctions, including a ban on Russian coal imports worth about €4bn (£3.3bn), by Friday and that measures against Russian oil would be discussed by foreign ministers on Monday. “Sooner or later, I hope sooner, it will happen,” he said. Zelenskiy is due to hold talks with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv on Friday, the Ukrainian government confirmed, adding that no advance details of the talks would be announced for security reasons. But while it welcomed the fresh sanctions announced by the EU, Britain and the US – which targeted two daughters of Vladimir Putin as well as Russia’s biggest public and private banks – Ukraine insisted that Europe in particular must go further. “We will continue to insist on a full oil and gas embargo for Russia,” Kuleba said. “I hope we will never face a situation again when to step up the sanctions pressure we need atrocities like Bucha to be revealed.” He stressed the vital importance of weapon supplies as well as sanctions, saying the deal Ukraine was offering was fair: “you give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine”. He added: “My agenda is very simple. It has only three items on it. It’s weapons, weapons and weapons.” EU sources said Europe’s ban on Russian coal imports – the key measure in its latest sanctions – would not take effect until August, a month later than previously proposed after pressure from Germany, the bloc’s top importer of Russian coal. The UK is due to ban Russian coal by the end of the year. Punitive measures on oil and gas, however, which are far more significant imports, have divided the EU27, with member states more dependent on imports from Russia afraid of the economic consequences. Russia accounts for about 40% of the EU’s natural gas consumption and a third of its oil imports. Ukraine on Thursday accused Hungary, which has said it is prepared to pay in roubles for Russian gas, of adopting an “unfriendly” position. “If Hungary really wants to help end the war, here’s how to do it: stop destroying unity in the EU,” foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said. Budapest should “support new anti-Russian sanctions, provide military assistance to Ukraine, and not create additional sources of funding for Russia’s military machine”, he added. “It is never too late to get on the right side of history.” Putin called Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has long sought a rapprochement with Moscow, to congratulate him after his party won a fourth consecutive term in general elections last week. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said a subsequent proposal by Budapest to host peace talks “looks cynical”."
Russian soldiers ‘discussed killing civilians’ in Ukraine in radio intercepts,2022-04-07T15:46:08Z,Kate Connolly in Berlin and Bethan McKernan in Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p3a,"Radio transmissions in which Russian soldiers appear to talk among themselves about carrying out premeditated civilian killings in Ukraine have been intercepted by Germany’s foreign intelligence service, a source close to the findings has said. The evidence was presented by officials from the foreign intelligence service, the BND, to parliamentarians on Wednesday. Reports of the radio communications were first published in the German news magazine Spiegel, which said the communications related to atrocities carried out in Bucha, north of Kyiv. Several of them can be directly matched to locations and objects shown in photos that document the aftermath of the killings, the magazine reported. A mass grave was discovered in Bucha at the weekend along with dozens of corpses of civilians lying on the ground, after the withdrawal of the Russian military. The hands of some of the dead were tied, while other corpses showed signs of torture. Numerous women and children are believed to have been among the victims. The Russian government has vehemently denied the claims that its soldiers carried out the killings, which world leaders including Joe Biden and Germany’s Olaf Scholz have described as war crimes. Russia has repeatedly claimed the killings have been staged. Still, increasing numbers of witness accounts have added to the veracity of the reports. The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine. In the radio communications, Russian soldiers were claimed to have discussed how they had questioned Ukrainian soldiers as well as civilians before shooting them. According to Spiegel, which indirectly referenced people who had been present at the meeting at which the BND officers delivered the fresh evidence to a select group of MPs, the recordings “entirely invalidate Russia’s denials”. In one of the radio conversations, a Russian voice is heard telling someone how he and another soldier shot a person who had been on a bicycle. One of the many pictures of the atrocities to have gone around the world in recent days was of the corpse of a person next to a bicycle. In another communication, a man was heard saying: “Firstly you question the soldier, then you shoot them.” The impression given was that the soldiers were talking matter-of-factly about the killings as if they were discussing everyday activities, the MPs were told, according to Spiegel. The intelligence material is also said to give credence to reports that the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was central participants in the killings. The group was previously active in the war in Syria where the vicious nature of its activities was notorious. Speaking on Thursday, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said the number of bodies found in the city was increasing every day, with 320 civilians identified so far. Specialist crime scene officers had retrieved corpses from private estates, parks and squares, he said, as well as from temporary graves. “Almost 90% were killed by bullets, not shrapnel,” he added. The BND’s recordings have intensified suspicions that these killings were neither random nor carried out by soldiers who might have been acting autonomously as has previously been suggested. Other radio recordings are being analysed, according to Spiegel. However, the precise localisation of them appears to be more difficult. They reportedly point to similar activities in other parts of Ukraine, in and around the port city of Mariupol which has been largely destroyed by Russian bombardment. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the expertise of forensic specialists in Europe was being sought as a matter of urgency, with independent experts needing to be ready to gather as much evidence as quickly as possible as soon as suspected atrocities came to light, of which the source said it was expected there would be many more. A massacre in Mali last week in which 300 people died and in which Russian fighters are alleged to have been involved had “all the hallmarks of the modus operandi of the Russian army”, the source said, adding it was similar to attacks the army had been involved in in Syria. This had raised the expectation that expert capacities to gather forensic evidence would increasingly be needed, the source added. In Ukraine on Thursday, as humanitarian relief teams and volunteers ventured further into territory around Kyiv retaken from Russian troops, evidence of more atrocities committed against Ukrainian civilians by the occupying force continued to emerge. As roads were cleared of mines and the wreckage of burned tanks and civilian cars, residents returned home to find their homes looted or destroyed, neighbours missing, bodies decomposing in basements, and hastily dug graves in gardens. The violence and death in towns and villages surrounding Kyiv stands out even by the abysmal standards of other conflict zones. Also on Thursday, Amnesty International published a report detailing apparent war crimes in the Kyiv region, based on interviews with 20 people who witnessed or had direct knowledge of horrifying violence. A woman in a village east of the capital told Amnesty’s investigators that on 9 March two Russian soldiers entered her house, killed her husband and repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid nearby. She later managed to escape to Ukrainian-controlled territory. In the village of Vorzel, Nataliya and Valeryi Tkachova left their basement on 3 March to check whether Russian tanks were coming, telling their 18-year-old daughter Kateryna to stay hidden. After hearing gunshots, Kateryna left the cellar to find her parents lying dead in the street, her father shot six times in the back, and her mother once in the chest. She was assisted in leaving Vorzel on 10 March. “Testimonies show that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary general, said in a statement. “The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime. These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command.”"
"Manchester United, Erik ten Hag and a summer of red-hot xG wibble",2022-04-07T15:42:34Z,John Brewin,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zkx,"ERIK THE RED Being bystanders to this week’s Big Cup, Euro Vase and even the Tin Pot Brendan’s brave Leicester boys are trying to win, these are dark days for Manchester United. The Ole dream died last winter and Ralf Rangick is a lame-duck caretaker manager/consultant/assistant to the regional manager. The top four, the last possible positive to glean from yet another wasted year, looks a straight shootout between Arsenal and Tottenham, the latter managed by Antonio Conte, someone reportedly scratched from the United candidates’ list for being the type of troublemaker who made José Mourinho look like a form prefect of the Phil Neville variety. The word among proper journalists is that Erik ten Hag is to be crowned the new boss of Big Red, a manager fitting the club’s preferred profile of being a young, progressive type with much to prove, nothing like the yesterday’s man appointments of José and Louis van Gaal. Ten Hag, the Ajax manager, is just 52 years old, and by the time he takes control in July, will be a whole 13 months younger than José when he took the job in 2016. For his first managerial appointment as chief suit since succeeding Ed Woodward, Richard Arnold, a man who once set his sights on the club being as popular on social media disgraces as Vin Diesel, has taken on the advice of back office-bound Ralfie, chief football suit John Murtough and chief tracksuit Darren Fletcher with co-owner Joel Glazer having the final say as, frankly, he and his kin have on everything happening in M16. That’s the Glazer family who, when fans cut up rough last year about the Super League and the general absolute state of things, promised fans could buy shares in the club to have more of a say. According to Big Website, such a venture may not actually happen, since votes for share-owning fans aren’t worth the ballot paper they are written on. Ten Hag has reportedly been selected ahead of World Cup-headed Luis Enrique, Sevilla head honacho Julen Lopetegui, and Mauricio Pochettino, the last of whom is now destined to be the United manager who never was. Even a late run from Tactics Tom, whose Chelsea team are blowing up in the style that once would have caused Roman Abramovich to speed dial Guus Hiddink, appears unlikely to delay King Erik’s coronation. The Fiver keenly awaits a summer of war chests, Harry Kane bids, red-hot xG tactics wibble, cod philosophy and profiles of the Dutchman as a young man. A new dawn has broken, has it not?

Macron steps up warnings over French far right before first-round vote,2022-04-07T15:20:14Z,Angelique Chrisafis in Paris,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p5y,"Emmanuel Macron has ramped up his warnings of the danger posed by Marine Le Pen before the first-round vote in France’s presidential election this weekend, as he acknowledged he had not managed to contain all voters’ fears and hold back the far right during his time in office. As Macron campaigns to become the first French president in 20 years to serve a second term, he has often been reminded of his 2017 victory speech in front of the Louvre where, after defeating Le Pen with 66% of the vote, he promised to ensure people had “no more reason to vote for extremes”. Polls suggest he could once again go through to a runoff against Le Pen after this Sunday’s vote, and that she would significantly close the gap on him in a 24 April final round, with a Harris poll this week putting Macron on 51.5% to Le Pen’s 48.5%. Le Pen has risen steadily in the polls in recent days, boosted by her promises to cut VAT on fuel in response to the cost of living crisis. Her political opponents have continued to warn that her anti-immigration project to prioritise native French people over non-French for housing, jobs and benefits, and to ban the Muslim headscarf from all public spaces, is xenophobic, racist and against the French constitution. In a front-page interview with Le Figaro on Thursday, Macron was asked whether he bore part of the responsibility for the high support for the far right in the polls. Macron said he believed his government had “succeeded in attacking” certain factors of the far-right vote by lowering unemployment, creating jobs and beginning a process whereby factories opened after long years of deindustrialisation. “But when you lead, govern or are president, you always have a part of responsibility,” he added. “On immigration, the results are insufficient, but we have reinforced border protections and hardened entry conditions to our territory in a context where the flow has considerably increased … due to the international context.” Macron said there had been more arrivals to France between 2017 and 2019 than in the two years previously. “A worry was born out of that: I haven’t managed to calm it, and it has fed the extremes.” But he added that France was not “submerged” by immigration. He said that if he won a second term, he would “reinforce the fight against illegal immigration” and facilitate sending home people who had not been approved to stay. Macron said the far right in France was still “fundamentally” the same: it attacked the Republic, had a base of antisemitism, “very clear xenophobia, and ultraconservative aims”. Support for the far right in the polls for the first round is at its highest point: Le Pen and her far-right rival Eric Zemmour, a former talkshow pundit, have more than 30% of support between them. Polls show Macron in first position for the first round on about 26.5%. Le Pen has risen to 23% in recent days. The hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon is in third on about 17% and also rising. A high number of undecided voters and a potentially high abstention rate means the outcome of Sunday’s first round remains open. Macron said Mélenchon’s hard-left movement was not in the same category as the far right but brought “simplistic arguments and counter-truths that cultivate fears” in the same way. Asked in another newspaper interview why he had not held back the tide of the far right, Macron said: “Extremes feed on fears, and fears are there: climate, geopolitics, the pandemic … I tried to bring answers. But when there are fears and big changes, the strategy of scapegoating works much better.” Macron has promised to use a second term to cut taxes further, bring France to full employment after decades of mass unemployment, and raise the retirement age to 65. He said inflation in France was half the rate of Britain’s because the government had taken efficient measures to block electricity price rises and provided anti-inflation payments to low-income households. Le Pen on Thursday brushed aside the worries of the financial markets over her rise in the polls. France’s borrowing costs increases as investors grew jittery over a closer-than-expected race. “The policies I want to implement are not meant for the stock markets, which will be a change from Emmanuel Macron,” she told RTL radio. Le Pen said if elected she would ban the Muslim headscarf from all public spaces, including the street. She said it would be enforced by police in the same way as seatbelt-wearing in cars. “People will be given a fine in the same way that it is illegal to not wear your seatbelt. It seems to me that the police are very much able to enforce this measure,” she said. Le Pen said the government’s tactic of catastrophising over her possible election no longer worked. “Scaremongering which entails saying that unless Emmanuel Macron is re-elected it will be a crisis, the sun will be extinguished, the sea will disappear and we’ll suffer an invasion of frogs no longer works.”"
Stephen Colbert on Russia: ‘We’ll have to start sanctioning them in the multiverse’,2022-04-07T15:17:00Z,Guardian staff,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zqa,"Stephen Colbert “If you’ve been paying attention to the news this week, I’m so sorry,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show, “because there is now a mountain of evidence that Russia has engaged in a series of brutal war crimes”. In response to reports of Russia targeting civilians and blocking humanitarian access, the US announced on Wednesday new sanctions on Russian financial institutions and individuals. “Good. I hope it makes a difference,” said Colbert. “But at this point, there are so many sanctions on Russia we might run out of places to put them. We’ll have to start sanctioning them in the multiverse. They’re going to have to block transactions with Russian banks that are in the dimension where Spider-Man is still Tobey Maguire.” The latest sanctions package will, among other things, ban all new investments in Russia. “Well, you’ve got to, otherwise their soaring economy is an irresistible cash magnet,” Colbert deadpanned. Colbert also mocked the billionaire Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, who “after years of tweeting silly memes and bad takes while at the same time constantly criticizing Twitter’s business practices”, bought a 9.2% stake in the company for $2.9bn, making him the largest single shareholder. “Wait a second! So if he doesn’t like how a corporation operates, he just buys it?” Colbert said. “How much more evidence do we need that he’s turning into a supervillain?” One of Musk’s first tweets post-sale was a poll asking: “do you want an edit button?” “Sure! I mean, I’d rather you cancel the accounts of all the Nazis, but an edit button would be nice,” Colbert responded. Seth Meyers On Late Night Seth Meyers tore into the congressional campaign of the former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. “I think Palin is in for a rude awakening if she thinks she’s still on the vanguard of wild and crazy Republicans,” said Meyers. “Palin showing up in Congress now would be like me telling a bunch of high school kids about my wild days of sneaking out and drinking wine coolers in the woods, and then realizing I was talking to the kids from Euphoria,” he continued. “They’d be like, ‘cool, man, I put molly on my oatmeal.’ “As if to prove that Sarah Palin would somehow not be the craziest Republican in Congress if she won,” the Florida congressman Matt Gaetz “leveled a bunch of unhinged conspiracies” at the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, on Tuesday. Gaetz, who is under federal investigation for sex trafficking, claimed the military cares more about critical race theory and “woke-ism” than national defense and wondered if the pullout from Afghanistan last year would have gone better “if the national defense university actually worked a little more on strategy and a little less on woke-ism”. “What is wrong with these people?” Meyers wondered. “In their fever swamp brains, do they genuinely believe our soldiers no longer know how to fire a rifle because they are buried from homework in pronoun class? Does he think they arrive on the battlefield and the sergeant barks out ‘all right Bravo team, go around the left flank and tell the enemy they’re beautiful just the way you are!’ “I have no problem with tough questioning of our national security officials, and I’m all for cutting the defense budget,” Meyers added. “It’s massively inflated and we could absolutely spend it better elsewhere, but that’s not even what the scam artists like Gaetz are asking for. They just want to whine about woke-ism and critical race theory. They don’t actually want to cut defense spending.” Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped the saga of an aggressive rabid fox at the Capitol, which bit several people on Tuesday. Representative Ami Bera, among the bitten, said the loose fox marked “one of the most unusual days on the Hill in 10 years”. “Yeah, with the exception of all those nutjobs trying to hang Mike Pence, but this was a solid number two,” Kimmel joked. Kimmel also remarked on a new round of sanctions on Russia. “I’m surprised they have any sanctions left,” he said. The new rounds target Russian banks and two of Putin’s adult children. “Wouldn’t it be something if what finally got Putin to stop this is his daughter going, ‘Dad! They cut off my credit card, you’ve got to do something!’” Kimmel said. “Can you imagine Vladimir as a dad-imir?” he added. “It seems like he would be a very strict father. When his kids misbehave, instead of their rooms they get sent to Siberia.”"
Bobby Rydell obituary,2022-04-07T15:14:35Z,Adam Sweeting,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7p5f,"One of the classic teen idols of the late 1950s and early 60s, Bobby Rydell, who has died from complications of pneumonia aged 79, was only seven when he began performing on stage in his home town of Philadelphia. Over the following 70 years, he would sing everything from rock’n’roll and smoochy love songs to disco, Broadway classics and Italian pop tunes. He notched up 19 singles in the Billboard Top 40, among the most successful of them We Got Love, Wild One and Volare. It was fitting that his name was chosen for Rydell high school in Grease, the Broadway and later film musical that depicted teenage lives in the early rock’n’roll days of the late 50s. If, as a New York Times critic put it, he was “more like a crooner than a rocker”, Rydell’s photogenic looks and endearing personality ensured he would prove far more durable than many flashier, more confrontational artists. Rydell and many of his generation were knocked off their pop pedestals by the dramatic arrival of the Beatles and their British counterparts, but he had the staying power of mainstream performers from a slightly earlier generation. He was born Robert Ridarelli in Philadelphia, the son of Jennie (nee Sapienza) and Adrio “Al” Ridarelli. His father was the foreman in a machine shop. Bobby grew up on South 11th Street, and in 1995 his career achievements were recognised by his home city when the street was renamed Bobby Rydell Boulevard. There is also a mural of Rydell on the boardwalk of Wildwood, New Jersey, the beach resort that inspired his 1963 hit Wildwood Days. His father kindled his musical interest by taking him to see the jazz bands of Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman, and he began playing drums and singing in nightclubs in Philadelphia and New Jersey at the age of seven. When he was nine, young Robert won a spot on the television show Paul Whiteman’s TV Teen Club and became a regular cast member. After three years on the show, he branched out into performing with local bands, including Rocco and the Saints – in which a fellow Philadelphian, Frankie Avalon, played the trumpet – and changed his name to Rydell. After cutting a few unsuccessful singles, Rydell signed to Cameo Records, and made his first appearance on the charts with the exuberant Kissin’ Time (1959). The follow-up, We Got Love, sold a million copies, igniting a streak of hits including Wild One, Swingin’ School, Ding-A-Ling and Volare. In 1961, aged 19 and now a confirmed teen heart-throb, he became the youngest performer to headline at the fabled Copacabana club in New York. In 1963 he was cast as Hugo Peabody in the film version of the musical Bye Bye Birdie, alongside Ann-Margret and Dick Van Dyke. Rydell recalled how the film’s director, George Sidney, “saw some kind of magic between Ann-Margret and myself, and every day that I went back to Columbia Studios, my script got bigger, and bigger, and bigger”. He was a regular guest on numerous TV shows, including those hosted by Red Skelton, Jack Benny, Joey Bishop, Perry Como and George Burns. “I had the good fortune to spend my peak years as a recording artist during the golden age of the TV variety show,” he wrote in his autobiography, Bobby Rydell: Teen Idol on the Rocks – A Tale of Second Chances (2016). His international reputation was boosted by tours in Europe and others to Australia – where he would tour 20 times – Japan and the far east. The Beatles scrambled to meet him when he visited Britain in 1963, and Paul McCartney has said that the Lennon and McCartney song She Loves You was based on a Rydell song, though he did not specify which one (Swingin’ School is a likely candidate). Nonetheless, by 1964 Rydell’s hits were drying up, though he reached No 4 that year with Forget Him, and his generation of performers was sidelined by the seismic impact of the Beatles and the British Invasion. His last appearance on Billboard’s Hot 100 was in 1965 with Diana, which reached No 98. Even signing a deal with Frank Sinatra’s Reprise label in 1968 could not reverse the slide, with Rydell complaining that Reprise gave him no promotion. Rydell could still command enough audience loyalty to tour regularly and appear in nightclubs and Las Vegas venues through the 1970s and 80s, performing the great American songbook of material by the likes of Cole Porter, George Gershwin and Richard Rodgers alongside his repertoire of pop and easy-listening material. He enjoyed a further glimmer of chart success with a disco version of his song Sway in 1976. In 1985 he joined Avalon and another former teen pop star, Fabian, to form a touring act, the Golden Boys. In 2020 he recalled: “I said to Frankie … ‘this is great, but how long is this going to last? A year, two years tops, it’s over.’ Well, that was in 1985, and we’re going on 2021, and we’re still doing the show. It’s amazing.” There had been some rocky moments along the way. The death of his wife, Camille Quattrone, in 2003, after 35 years of marriage, tipped him into life-threatening alcoholism. “Vodka became a very, very dear friend,” he said, “to the point where, a few years later, it led to a double transplant. A new liver and a new kidney, because of all the drinking.” He married Linda Hoffman in 2009. His alcohol-induced illness forced him to cancel an Australian tour in 2012. After transplant surgery, he returned to the stage the following year with three sold-out shows in Las Vegas. His career had “had its ups and downs, its peaks and valleys”, he said, “but I’ve survived through all of that, and I continue to do what I really enjoy doing”. He is survived by Linda and by two children, Robert and Jennifer, from his first marriage. • Bobby Rydell (Robert Louis Ridarelli), singer and musician, born 26 April 1942; died 5 April 2022"
Wiegman insists there is no risk making Williamson the new England captain,2022-04-07T15:12:21Z,Suzanne Wrack in Skopje,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7pv4,"Sarina Wiegman has praised the development of Leah Williamson, who is yet to start at a major international tournament for England but will captain the team at the Euros this summer, as the Lionesses prepare to face North Macedonia in World Cup qualifying on Friday. Williamson was on the fringes at the 2019 Women’s World Cup, with the six minutes the Arsenal defender played against Cameroon, having been brought on as a late substitute by Phil Neville, her only action of the tournament in France. Not only is Williamson set to be in the starting XI when the Euros get going at Old Trafford on 6 July but she will do so wearing the armband. “I followed her before I came in here as the manager, she’s a very talented player,” said Wiegman, England’s head coach. “Now, she has so many more high-level and high-intensity games in her legs and in her brain. That has really helped her. She’s more mature, she can still grow – I’m still growing, we’re all still growing every day – but she’s ready for the opportunity on and off the pitch.” Wiegman denied there was a risk in making someone with so little major tournament experience the national team captain at a home Euros. She said: “She’s herself and she won’t be a different person when she wears the armband. I do think that we have shared responsibilities, so what we shouldn’t do is put it all on the shoulders of Leah. As a team we all have responsibilities and, when it’s needed, she steps up and talks or uses her way of leadership.” England will be without Williamson for the game in Skopje as the 25-year-old has missed training and been under precautionary concussion protocols. The hope is she will be fit for Tuesday’s game with Northern Ireland. “She is doing well,” said Wiegman. “She came into camp good, but we didn’t want to take any risks. She had a little bit of a headache, so we take the medical protocols. She just needs to take a little more time in her programme to build her up. Also, no heading [in training] so she’s not ready for the game on Friday.” England will also be without Williamson’s Arsenal centre-back partner Lotte Wubben-Moy and Manchester City defender Alex Greenwood for Friday’s game. The pair have not travelled because of knee and thigh injuries respectively. Everton’s Gabby George, who was in camp with the Under-23s, has been called in. Looking ahead to the Euros, Wiegman believes her squad is in a “good place”, adding: “You always want more as a coach, more time, but the time schedule is so clear, you have this time, these camps, and that’s what you have and you have to do your job. “I was really happy with the games we had in February, they were really competitive, this is another opponent, we all know the reason why we play these matches [so close to the Euros], because Covid delayed things, so we just have to deal with the situation and be agile. We know on 6 July we have to be ready for the Euros.”"
Co-op warns about food supplies and inflation as profits fall 57%,2022-04-07T15:04:44Z,Sarah Butler,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z42,"The Co-op Group has warned of continuing problems with food supplies and inflation after revealing that profits more than halved last year amid supply chain disruption and higher staff wages. The mutual said underlying profit for 2021, stripping out a one-off £99m gain relating to the sale of the Co-operative Bank in 2017, was down 57% to £100m, compared with the year before, and that sales slipped to £11.2bn, from £11.5bn. Sales at the group’s food business fell by 2% to £9.1bn despite investing £140m in opening 50 new stores and refitting 87 more, and spending £18m on cutting prices. While in-store sales declined, online sales soared from £70m the year before to £200m thanks in part to tie-ups with Deliveroo and Amazon. Sales also slipped at the Co-op’s funerals business, declining by £8m to £264m. Shirine Khoury-Haq, the incoming interim chief executive of the Co-op, said: “The last year has seen us facing some significant challenges, including significant supply chain issues in the second half coming at the same time as our food business transformation and increasing inflationary pressures. “The difficult operating environment disproportionately impacted our food business, given its focus on the community convenience market, with an operating model that is more reliant on flexibility in the supply chain.” She said the Co-op would be reexamining its current strategy of opening 50 to 100 stores a year as she suspected change would be required given the shift to online shopping and cost challenges. Khoury-Haq said inflation and supply chain problems were not just being prompted by the war in Ukraine, which has driven up the price of energy and affected supplies of wheat and edible oils. Even the price of coffins in the group’s funeral business have increased because of global shortages of wood and other resources partly as a result of the pandemic. Problems with heavy rainfall and flooding in Spain, which supplies large amounts of fresh vegetables to the UK at this time of the year, have also hit supplies of broccoli, courgettes and other vegetables. Khoury-Haq, who replaces Steve Murrells in May, said the Co-op had been forced to source elsewhere or offer alternatives because of shortages. She said some food price increases were “inevitable” this year, but the Co-op was trying to mitigate the problems for customers by not raising the price on 1,000 key items and adding 100 extra products to its budget range. The Co-op said it was outperforming the grocery market. However, it expected its food business to “face continued challenges during the year” amid “inflationary pressures and the economic uncertainty facing customers”. Allan Leighton, the chair of the Co-op, said: “The economic headwinds look stark and will be tricky to navigate but through our continued planned strategic investments our Co-op is well placed to ride out the storm and prosper beyond.”"
Las Vegas GP signals F1’s ambition of US expansion at Europe’s expense,2022-04-07T15:04:33Z,Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7kvv,"Formula One returns to Australia this weekend after a two-year absence since the sport’s blase attitude toward the oncoming pandemic left it reeling when the meeting in Melbourne fell apart. Mismanagement and hubris had brought F1 low but, finally back at Albert Park, it could not be in ruder health. F1’s insistence on pushing on with holding the race was wildly over-ambitious, up to and including allowing fans to turn up at the gates, only not to be admitted as the event was called off with Covid cases among the teams. That weekend was a nadir for F1’s owners and the FIA. But the recovery has been nothing short of remarkable. As other sports floundered, F1 put on 17 races in 2020 and 22 in 2021, including one of the great championship fights. This season the plan is to hold 23 races and, last week, F1 announced a race in Las Vegas next year. The significance of which goes far beyond the mere publicity and glamour of staging a race on the Strip. The Las Vegas GP will take place in November, on a Saturday at 10pm local time, the usual Sunday afternoon scheduling summarily dismissed in order to hit prime time TV in the United States. With Miami and Texas already on the calendar, the US will host three meetings in 2023. Given the sport’s recent history there, this is an extraordinary feat. F1 enjoyed great popularity in the US in the 60s and 70s, with Watkins Glen, New York rammed with fans, but it has struggled since then. From the 1980s on there were periods without a GP, while the brief spell at Indianapolis between 2000 and 2007 ended in ignominy. Racing returned in 2012 at Austin, a meeting that for some time struggled to bring in the numbers. Bernie Ecclestone had long tried to pull off a GP in Las Vegas but never succeeded. Since Liberty Media took over the sport in 2017, however, its efforts to drag F1 into the modern age have paid off and Vegas is the definitive evidence. A concerted effort has been made to attract a new, younger audience, targeting social media as part of making the sport accessible and aiming at a large, inclusive global demographic, rather than relying on a traditional, ageing fanbase. Part of that strategy was allowing Netflix to make the Drive To Survive series about the sport. Its success has been a vindication and a priceless marketing tool, especially in the US, as recognised by F1’s CEO, Stefano Domenicali. “The beauty of the growth of our sport in this country is we are reaching a lot of young people that are starting to be thrilled by our sport,” he said. “To think that next year we’re going to have three races in the US, if you think back a couple of years ago, you would say you are crazy.” Yet three races there will be as F1’s numbers come up. Austin drew in 400,000 fans over the weekend last year, while last season the US broadcaster ESPN enjoyed consistently rising viewing figures, including the sport’s highest since 1995. Austin and Miami are expected to be sellouts this year. Liberty has long made a point of wanting to expand in the US and, in the case of Las Vegas, it has boldly stepped up to make it a reality. The race is being promoted by F1 in conjunction with the city and a group of hotels and casinos. F1 has put itself up to take any potential losses should the event prove unpopular. It is a brave decision and something Liberty would not have dared try without the increase in the sport’s popularity. Las Vegas last hosted two, unloved, GPs in 1981 and 1982 on a terrible circuit built in the car park of the Caesars Palace casino, attracting poor crowds and viewing figures despite hosting championship deciders. This time it is hard to imagine the meeting being a failure. The 3.8-mile track will stretch around the city’s landmarks, the Strip, the Bellagio fountains, Caesars, the Paris Casino. Visually, at the very least, this is the backdrop F1’s owners have fantasised about. But it comes at a price. The season is capped at 24 races according to the commercial agreement with the teams, a number 2023 is already set to exceed. It appears that, largely, European races are in the danger. With Vegas, Qatar and China all set to race in 2023, there would be 25 meetings and that does not include the determination to add a meeting in Africa as soon as possible. Domenicali has already mooted the idea that some races will have to be on and off the calendar on a rota basis in future. Belgium, France and Mexico have no contract for next year and none of them can compete financially with the big money being hurled around in the Middle East. Monaco, too, must be considered as at risk. The track is wholly unsuited to the large, heavy modern F1 cars and its former special status in not having to pay a hosting fee has been removed by F1. For many European fans this is the unacceptable cost of expansion in the US, but it is the reality of a success story that sits in stark contrast to the painful humility of Australia in 2020. F1 is vibrant, popular and expanding globally. Bringing Las Vegas on board is the sign of a sport utterly confident in this roll of the dice."
Qatar 2022 raises more questions of how to navigate modern football’s moral maze,2022-04-07T15:00:05Z,Max Rushden,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nt6,"On 2 December 2010, I was hosting an event on behalf of the England 2018 World Cup bid outside City Hall in central London. It was toe-curlingly cold. My co-host, Charlotte Jackson, and I were joined by Peter Crouch and David Ginola among others to celebrate England’s certain success – the first World Cup on home soil since ’66. We were favourites. It was a good bid, albeit laced with that hubris that we often fail to acknowledge. They do actually play football in other countries. A small crowd were in some temporary seating as we beamed pictures back from Switzerland. We got word of the result 20 minutes before it was officially announced. The crowd had already started to ebb away when Sepp Blatter stood at the lectern and laboured over opening an envelope with the word Russia written on both sides. The director shouted down my earpiece. “Just fill for the next 10 minutes so the crowd stay for the 2022 result.” Trying to retain a withering and despondent crowd in sub-zero temperatures proved too much for my broadcasting abilities. By the time Qatar was officially given the tournament we were talking to a couple of unsuspecting dog walkers. The hot chestnut seller by the river had a bigger audience. Even our guests had gone inside. We have heard a great deal about Qatar in the following 11 years. We’ve been through the corruption allegations, the realisation that it’s hot in the summer in the Middle East and the tragedy of the (disputed) number of migrant worker deaths. And now we have the complex job of working out how to cover it. On the Guardian Football Weekly podcast the other day I asked an open question about what we should do. I genuinely don’t know the answer. Do we record one episode about human rights at the start of the tournament and then forget all about it and focus on the football? There will be countless journalists and ex-pros who don’t even do that – before we even consider those taking money from Fifa to promote it. I was as guilty as anyone of nodding to the invasion of Crimea and the repression of political opposition in Russia before 2018 and then forgetting it all as England reached the semi-final. Should I have spent less time worrying about why the Croatians weren’t tired and more questioning how this tournament was legitimising Vladimir Putin’s regime? I have literally no idea what, if any, impact hosting the World Cup contributed to the horrifying scenes we see today. But I don’t think I used my platform enough regardless of whether it would have made a jot of difference. The latest Amnesty International report into private security firms who employ tens of thousands of migrant workers in Qatar is pretty damning. It says they are still subject to “forced labour” and a number of other abuses and it criticises Fifa for failing “to put in place adequate processes” to address these issues. So this time around should we break off our discussion of Harry Kane’s late penalty to beat Iran to find out if the working conditions of migrants really have changed? After Ghana get retribution against Uruguay do we talk about what life is like for the LGBTQ+ community in Qatar? As Jonathan Wilson said on the podcast, this World Cup will be one of gear changes. Journalists and broadcasters will know workers died providing the stadiums from where they are reporting. “Hey Max,” wrote someone on Twitter. “I hope between now and the World Cup you can work out your duty as a ‘journalist’ when covering the tournament. Because your answer of ‘I don’t know’ is a little disappointing … Feels a bit of a cop out. Let’s hope you can work out your job by the end of the year!” Is it a cop out to be unsure of yourself on such complicated issues? Or is it good to be honest? Social media can be blamed for many things, one of which is a seeming desperation for journalists and pundits of all kinds – not just within sport – to have unequivocal opinions on everything. Outrage and fury certainly get more retweets than saying: “It’s complicated and I’m just not quite sure.” Saying you don’t know, or worse, that you were wrong about something, appears now to be an admission of complete failure. The more understanding we get on the bleakness in sport below the surface, the less I really know how to cover it or what our priorities should be. Clearly this goes beyond Qatar. I routinely fail to mention Abu Dhabi’s human rights abuses during my coverage of Manchester City. I want people to ask Eddie Howe about the number of people executed in Saudi Arabia. But to what end? To get him and the players to walk out on principle and the fans to follow? It goes beyond the Middle East and human rights – the gamblification of football, the racism, the misogyny, the worrying link to domestic and sexual violence. I don’t check where all the money is coming from all the time. In December 2010, when that draw was made, social media hadn’t permeated our lives to the extent that you could scroll through war crimes while you sit on the toilet. Dejan Lovren might have hated the idea of teaching children about being open-minded towards different sexualities. Matt Le Tissier might have engaged in conspiracy theories, but they had no way of telling me. I miss that blissful ignorance. I knew nothing of Qatar and I spent very little time thinking about human rights. “It was a different time” people say, and it feels like it was to me. Perhaps I’ll learn how to do my job by the time the World Cup begins. Now back to Frank Lampard’s excuses, Diego Simeone’s shithousery and Kalvin Phillips’s Cornish pasty shoes."
‘I saw a guy being decapitated when I was seven’: Murina director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović ,2022-04-07T14:41:35Z,Cath Clarke,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7eqm,"Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović was nine months pregnant when she walked on stage at Cannes last July for the premiere of her movie Murina. The Croatian director had flown to Europe a couple of months earlier from New York, where she lives, after doctors had told her that May was her cut-off point for plane travel. The plan was to have her baby in the south of France: everything was organised. But after a couple of days in Cannes – “I partied, I danced, I went to the beach, I swam, dined, met great people” – Kusijanović felt a need to give birth in her own country. “It was a strange emotional push. Like, OK, it’s time to go.” Knowing that she could go into labour at any moment, she drove 13 hours from Cannes to Croatia with her husband and straight to hospital, where she gave birth to her son. Twelve hours later there was a call from the festival – she had won the Camera d’Or prize, for best first feature, would she like to go to the ceremony? “I mean, of course I couldn’t go back to Cannes, no!” Kusijanović says, laughing. But you wouldn’t put it past her. After spending an entertaining hour with Kusijanović, it is clear is that she is a force of nature, no nonsense, outspoken with a fiery and funny sense of humour. She’s speaking over Zoom from Texas, where she’s working on her second film. Nine-month-old Petrus (Cannes bestowed on him a lifetime accreditation in honour of his timely arrival) is napping in the next-door room. Her film Murina is brilliant: executive produced by Martin Scorsese and (mostly) ecstatically reviewed. Variety’s critic compared it to Patricia Highsmith, “if Highsmith had ever written a coming-of-age story set on the rocky, clear-watered Croatian coastline”. Quite rightly, Kusijanović is being hailed as a distinctive new voice in cinema. Kusijanović says she started writing the script before #MeToo, but Murina is a film for our times, about machismo, ego and suffocating masculinity. It’s the story of a 16-year-old girl called Julija (Gracija Filipović), growing up in a sleepy Croatian fishing village with her fisherman dad, Ante (Leon Lučev), and mum, Nela (Danica Curcic). To tourists, their existence looks idyllic. But Ante is a controlling and petulant patriarchal figure who demands total obedience from his wife and daughter. Like a psychological thriller or escape movie, the question is: can Julija break free of her father and the conformist values of her community? What has been fascinating about screening Murina in Croatia, says Kusijanović, is that misogyny is so ingrained that some people miss it as a theme. “They will say: ‘What’s happening in this film? This is a normal family. Nothing really happens.’” Is Ante’s domineering behaviour rationalised by the audience as part of Croatian culture? Kusijanović nods vigorously “Yes! But it’s not culture, it’s not mentality. That’s wrong!” Getting into her stride, she jabs her finger down the screen. “People think it’s normal: it’s our hot Mediterranean blood or whatever. It’s not, it’s just violence. We can passionately sing and cook great fish. That’s mentality. The rest is violence.” It drives her nuts when she’s in Croatia. “I get arrhythmia when I step out of the airport into a cab.” She catches herself and bursts out laughing. “I’m really bad. How is this going to sound?” Kusijanović was born in Dubrovnik, into a family that could not be further from Julija’s in the film. Her mother is a successful art restorer and painter. “I was very lucky to grow up in a family of very strong women. I actually discovered feminism very late. I didn’t know that I need to call myself a feminist because there was just a feminist way of life in our family.” She became a child actor, working from the age of six, mostly in theatre. “I was very extrovert and outgoing. I’d be the one gathering the kids in my street for a theatre show. From the age of five I was directing, actually.” It was also around this time that Kusijanović’s childhood was swept up in the violence of the Balkan war. Her family fled Croatia as refugees in 1991, living overseas for a couple of years, first in Italy, then at a monastery in Austria and, finally, in Germany. “I thought of it as travelling. My mother was really amazing at pulling that off. She really made it feel like a game. I don’t know if I could do that with my son.” When they returned to Dubrovnik, the family’s apartment inside the city walls had been partially destroyed by a grenade. And then there was the trauma; one day Kusijanović’s primary school teacher was concerned enough to call in her mother. “I was writing dark poems. ‘My city is bleeding’ – that was the name of one poem. I was writing a lot about the fight between good and evil.” Terrifyingly, after the war, back in Croatia, Kusijanović had a near-death experience in a landmine explosion. Driving in the mountains on a narrow road with her family, they met an oncoming car. As the two cars nudged past each other, the other car drove on to a mine: “Our front wheel was 10cm from the landmine. The other car blew up in the air and fell on our car. The guy who was driving was decapitated. I was seven. I saw everything.” She says that one day she would like to write a story, something with a fantastical element, of a child’s view of war. How did being a child of war shape her? Kusijanović pauses for a moment, deep in thought. “Since very early years I had a very strong sense of time. I think that’s what formed me most. I don’t think there’s anything worse than not fulfilling your time and your potential. It’s a real sin.” Another long pause. “War is a very stupid thing There’s no good reason to be in a war.” She must be watching the horror in Ukraine very closely, I say. “Yes, of course. It feels awfully familiar.” When she was 27, Kusijanović began a master’s degree in film at Columbia University. The story of how she first picked up a camera sounds like an episode of The Sopranos. A few years before the MA, she decided to make a documentary about a labour dispute between union and non-union construction workers in her New York neighbourhood. It seemed entertaining: one day, someone brought a giant inflatable rat. “It was really fascinating until I scratched too deep.” After being followed by heavies for a few days, things turned nasty. First intimidation: “They said to give up on this story, otherwise I might disappear.” She told them where to stick it. When the threats turned physical, the police advised her to stop her film. That sounds terrifying. She shrugs. “If you don’t fight for something that matters, you should not do anything. I would never just direct a cute story. I don’t have the time. Because, you know, I can die tomorrow.” What she is up for, however, is something on the scale of a superhero movie. Even before I get the question out, she answers: “I wanna do that! If you know someone who’s gonna offer me that, I’m ready to go.” I wouldn’t second guess her. • Murina is released on 8 April. Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović will also take part in Q&amp;As on 8 April at Curzon Bloomsbury, 9 April at Cine Lumiere, and 10 April at the Garden Cinema and Genesis Cinema, in London."
Akshata Murty’s non-dom status is a choice not an obligation – tax experts,2022-04-07T14:29:18Z,Rupert Neate,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z55,"This is the government form that the chancellor’s wife Akshata Murty will have filled in to apply for non-domiciled status in order to avoid paying UK tax on tens of millions in dividends collected from her family’s Indian IT business empire. When it was revealed on Wednesday that Murty was a non-dom, and thereby not required to pay UK tax on about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in Infosys, her spokeswoman said Murty “is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes” suggesting that she had no control over her UK tax status. However, all UK residents must actively apply for non-dom status by filing in government tax form SA109 to claim the tax relief. Murty’s spokeswoman suggested that because Murty was an Indian citizen she could not also hold UK citizenship and therefore must be treated as a non-dom for UK tax. Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents’ home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income”. However, several leading international tax experts have disputed this and said tax domicile status is not connected with a person’s nationality. Those resident in the UK do not have to have a British passport in order to pay British taxes, meaning Murty could have paid UK tax at any time. Richard Murphy, a professor of accounting at Sheffield University management school and tax justice campaigner, said: “Domicile has nothing to do with a person’s nationality. Nor does it have anything to do with not being able to have a British passport because a person holds citizenship from another country. And non-domiciled status is certainly never given for that reason.” Murphy said non-dom status was given only to people who applied for it. “In that case the implication in Ms Murty’s statement that she has to be treated as non-domiciled is simply wrong. She is only non-domiciled because she asked to be so. “She can also give up the claim to be non-domiciled at any time,” he added. “Just because she was non-domiciled when she arrived in the UK as a newly married person does not mean she has to keep the status now. So the fact she’s still non-dom is also a choice.” Arun Advani, assistant professor at the University of Warwick’s economics department and an expert on non-dom tax law, said: “Citizenship has nothing to do with whether you choose to/not to claim remittance basis in the UK.” How much tax should Murty have paid? Murty’s spokeswoman said she had paid tax on the dividends she collects from her stake in Infosys, which is estimated to be worth about £690m, but has refused to state how much or in which country she paid the tax. Last year she collected dividends of £11.6m. As a higher rate taxpayer she would have been expected to pay a 38.1% tax on the payout, which works out at £4.4m. Sunak has since increased the rate to 39.35%. Where does she pay tax on her Infosys dividends? Many countries do not charge any tax on dividend payments. If Murty collected the dividend in one of these countries it means she could have “paid” all the tax due even if there was no tax to pay. She has previously collected other dividend income via the tax haven of Mauritius, which does not tax dividends. Robert Palmer, executive director of campaign group Tax Justice UK, said: “Ordinary people who face an increase to their national insurance contributions this week will be shocked to learn that the chancellor’s own wife is a non-dom. This status could potentially save her substantial amounts of tax. “Tax is about political choices. The government should end tax loopholes such as non-dom status and make sure that those who have wealth pay their share.” Murty is understood to have lived in the UK for nine years, and her team have suggested she will “automatically be deemed domiciled after living in the UK for 15 years”. The experts said Murty could choose to be UK domiciled at any point, and is choosing to be non-domiciled by filling in the SA109 form every year. Furthermore, non-domicile people resident in the UK have since 2017 been required to pay an “annual charge” of £30,000 for the rights to the status “if you’ve been here for at least seven of the previous nine tax years”. Her spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment about whether Murty pays the levy. Boris Johnson declined to answer questions about Murty on a visit to Somerset this morning, saying: “I think as far as we possibly can in politics it is a good thing to steer clear of wives and families in political discussion.”"
"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",2022-03-17T15:52:23Z,"Andrew Roth, Dan Sabbagh, Paul Scruton, Harvey Symons, Finbarr Sheehy, Glenn Swann and Niels de Hoog",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y44nn,"What’s the latest? Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. Russian air attacks are now focused mainly on areas of eastern Ukraine, and Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the region, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said. Russia’s defence ministry says it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the southeast of the country. There are set to be ten humanitarian corridors open for civilian evacuations across Ukraine today, but Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said residents trying to leave Mariupol will again have to use their own vehicles. The mayor of the besieged city says over 100,000 people still need urgent evacuation from the city, and that more than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion. Recently released drone footage shows the northern Ukrainian town of Borodyanka in ruins, days after it was retaken from Russian forces by Ukraine’s army: Footage filmed on Wednesday also shows destruction in Bucha, Gostomel and Irpin, all to the west of Kyiv. What happened in first three weeks of the invasion? How did we get here? In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. What do we know about Russia’s deployments? Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. How do the militaries compare? Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. What is the historical context? In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. What was the role of Nord Stream 2? On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion."
Old Enough: the Japanese TV show that abandons toddlers on public transport,2022-04-07T14:13:33Z,Stuart Heritage,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nz7,"If you have looked at Netflix over the past few days, there is an overwhelming chance that you will have been bashed over the head by a weird-looking Japanese documentary. No matter what your viewing history is – whether you prefer Bridgerton or Stranger Things, Breaking Bad or second world war documentaries – there it is. Floating in multicoloured bubble letters, devoid of any context whatsoever, is the title Old Enough. Which begs the question: what the hell is Old Enough? Unfortunately, the initial explanation is even more confusing than Netflix’s aggressive push. Old Enough is the wildly popular Japanese show Hajimete no Otsukai (My First Errand), an entertainment documentary show where toddlers are sent out into the world completely alone, to go shopping or navigate public transport. In Japan, Old Enough has been airing for 30 years, with two three-hour shows broadcast each year. When it airs, a fifth of all Japanese viewers tune in. It’s a true phenomenon. The length between episodes can be explained by the sheer level of preparation that goes into each task. All the errand routes are inspected by parents and production staff, to check for dangerous roads or “suspicious persons”. The children are chosen after a laborious selection process, the camera crew and safety team are given hiding places so the kids won’t spot them and all the local neighbours are informed of the task, so as not to freak out and call the police when they see a four-year-old wandering aimlessly through the streets. Part of the appeal, from what I can tell, is the show’s ability to instil confidence into the children. They’re all aged between two and six years old, and they’re almost always scared to death when they first set out. Rightly so, because walking a mile to a shop alone can be a terrifying prospect for a toddler. However, the big heartwarming punch that usually comes at the end is a newfound pride in their abilities. The kids had an adventure, and they weren’t helped, and they did it. So that’s what Old Enough is. Netflix’s aggressive stance on shoving it at the top of everyone’s homepage is harder to explain. The arrival of Old Enough was greeted with a flurry of press releases from the Japanese broadcaster Nippon, hailing a partnership with Netflix for 30 of its shows. Whether those shows – including Death Note, Your Turn to Kill and Life’s Punchline – will be given the same attention remains to be seen. Now for the big question: is Old Enough any good? The answer is a resounding “sort of”. The good news is that the Netflix versions are much shorter than the original programmes. These are all less than 20 minutes long, rather than three hours. It is a resoundingly sweet show. For the most part, you can’t help but root for the children. In the first episode, a very young boy walks to the supermarket to pick up three items, narrating his adventure to himself as he goes. Later on in the series, we see a young girl attempt an errand, only to rush back to her mother in tears after getting lost before overcoming her nerves and setting out again. It is an absolute rollercoaster of emotions that leaves you in tatters, and you suspect this is why it has such a dedicated following in Japan. That said, this is a very Japanese show, in terms of concept and execution. Japanese words continually pop up onscreen in cartoonish font, and each onscreen action is accompanied by what sounds like canned laughter or applause, which can be off-putting. Either way, if you think Old Enough is inescapable now, just wait. A British remake is apparently in the works."
girls girls girls review – Simone Rocha curates a dazzling display of art by women,2022-04-07T14:06:07Z,Claire Armitstead,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7k6j,"Huge, ancient magnolias are in full bloom in Ireland’s oldest garden, which surrounds Lismore Castle, in the Waterford countryside. Mauve aubretia crawls up stone walls, while stiff white daffodils and maroon fritillaries bow and curtsy to each other on the lawns. Edmund Spenser is said to have composed his epic poem The Faerie Queene in the gnarly yew walk in the late 16th century, though the magnolias were a Victorian addition, creating a glorious spring garden for successive dukes of Devonshire. It’s almost as if the 1922 creation of the Irish Free State never happened, except of course we, the general public, are only here because it did. The compulsory purchase of land from English landowners that followed it left Lismore with seven acres with which to support the upkeep of a whole heap of crumbling masonry. The response of the latest heirs, the Earl and Countess of Burlington, has been to rent out the castle over the summer, let the formal gardens run wild, and convert one of its derelict outbuildings into an art gallery, which has been operating as a not-for-profit enterprise since 2005. Its new summer show – girls girls girls – is a class act, both cheekily of the moment and locked in a whispered conversation with its historic surroundings. In the case of one painting, Genieve Figgis’s Upstairs Downstairs, the whisper becomes a shout. This is the only work that was personally selected by its (Irish) artist: it’s Downton Abbey meets the Mexican day of the dead, with ghoulish lords and ladies flanked by de-faced maidservants, in a travesty of one of those excruciating all-together photographs that were so beloved of Victorian aristocrats. The painting commands attention, striking a subversive note that feels a bit out of kilter until you turn around and find the discomfort staring back at you from the opposite wall, where a pair of black twins in neat blue frocks stand, looking away from each other, with their hands anxiously clasped. There’s no explanatory text (a catalogue is promised in the summer), leaving curator Simone Rocha to explain the story behind Mozambique-born Cassi Namoda’s painting: these were real twins, who were born into slavery in the US and sold to a circus freak show. Rocha, a fashion designer who has created quite a thrill in her native Ireland, has used her licence as a charismatic art-world outsider to gather an impressively varied, international collection of work by female artists with an age span between them of nearly 90 years. The oldest is Louise Bourgeois, a longtime muse of Rocha, who would be 110 if she were still alive. The youngest is just 23. All were chosen for works that “inspire, challenge and engage with femininity and its subversive characteristics”. Some stare you down and others are more hidden, she says. “I wanted them to all speak to each other.” The tortures of fashion are never far away. A pink patterned blouse is embalmed in wax by the German Canadian artist Iris Haeussler. It looks as if it’s gasping for air. Ouch, I felt, as I reeled from Dorothy Cross’s 1994 cow-udder installation Stilettos – each pointed toe a shrivelled teat – to a surrealist photograph by Petra Collins of shoes so deforming that one big toe juts out like an old tree trunk. But if you lean too hard on overt connections, you might miss the delicate, Chagall-like whimsicality of Georgian artist Elene Chantladze, a one-off, whose paintings on stone and old cardboard sit in two vitrines. The baby of the show is the formidably talented Sian Costello, who works in Limerick and is yet to be snapped up by a gallery. Her three paintings titled Wishful Self-Portrait show a girl who could be a Velázquez infanta, or a model in one of Rocha’s puffy Victorian nightie-inspired gowns that were much in evidence over the launch weekend, but was inspired by Whistler’s women in white, says Costello. The images are smudgy, ambivalent, and one is missing her head, so that all that remains is the performance of her frock. These little girls punch above their weight. Twenty-six-year-old Sophie Barber exerts a different sort of authority, dominating the long gallery with a huge oil painting of two pink huts on stilts, mysteriously titled The Greatest Song a Songbird Ever Sang. Look sideways, and there are two sets of songbirds smooching in miniature. One is of actual birds (Barber, who grew up and still lives in Hastings, cites her birder father as a key influence). The other is of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. To give such a young artist such pole position is a bold and sisterly move, and in both scale and colour (there’s a lot of pink in the room so, hey, why not shout it loud?), it works. It’s not until you get to the two ante-rooms that the doyennes of the show appear. A series of Cindy Sherman’s crisply composed Bus Riders self-portraits sit at a right angle to a series of closeups of Roni Horn’s weather-battered face on a trip to Iceland. The lips of Polish Holocaust survivor Alina Szapocznikow are lit up in a ghoulish humanoid table lamp made from a lump of orange resin shortly before her premature death in 1973. Only then do we arrive at two pieces by Bourgeois, tucked away in their own little turret at the show’s farthest reach. Rocha says she chose 1968’s Janus in Leather Jacket because of its reference to clothing, but to the uninitiated eye, it dangles in mid-air like a fat turd that someone has tried to cover up with pages from a book. An untitled 1993 bronze cross of four clasped hands, with a little house at the end of one arm, points an ironic elbow at the relationship between women and home. The positioning makes you think as well as wait. The turret is both a life sentence and a fantasy: a constraining Bourgeois cell, and a perfect little tower-room in a fairytale castle, such as little girls dream of before they awake to the realities of life. Though girls girls girls is the main attraction, it’s not the only show in town. A kilometre along the road in an old methodist chapel, the American artist Matt Connors has installed four bright, abstract paintings which exactly replicate its windows but are placed upside down on the opposite wall. The installation is titled Invert, a nod to his struggles with his own sexuality and catholicism. At the right time of day, when the late afternoon sun slants through the stained glass, casting a brilliantly coloured net across the floor, you could stand here and bathe in the beauty of being out and proud. girls girls girls is at Lismore Castle Arts, Lismore, County Waterford, until 30 October"
Escape from Mariupol: the man who swam to safety from Russian terror,2022-04-07T14:03:29Z,Luke Harding in Lviv,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nkx,"Dmitry Yurin was at home on 16 March when a Russian bomb struck Mariupol’s drama theatre. His flat in Prospect Mira was a couple of hundred metres away, across a square with a fountain. The theatre had become a capacious air raid shelter. Hundreds of women and children were inside. “It was terrible, a massive blast, an enormous explosion. I heard cries and screams,” Yurin said. “I saw bodies and bits of bodies. I pulled one woman out, then a girl, and then a boy. All were hurt. The boy’s legs didn’t move. He was screaming. My hands were shaking. I was covered in blood.” Nearby a woman lay motionless on the ground. Family members were desperately attempting to resuscitate her, pressing on her chest. “They were trying to bring her back. There was a child standing next to her, saying: ‘Mum, don’t sleep.’ The woman was dead.” The exact number of people who perished in the Russian air strike is still unknown. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says 300 people were killed. Witnesses including Yurin confirm there were dozens of bodies. They say continuous Russian shelling made rescue work dangerous. Yurin said he went back to the garage where he had been sheltering with his mother, Nadezhda, lit a cigarette and swallowed some tablets. He decided he had to get out of Mariupol, which for two gruesome weeks Russian forces had attacked and besieged. The city was cut off from all directions. He came up with an extraordinary plan. Yurin decided he would swim to safety. A keen fisherman, he had spent hours on the Sea of Azov with his father catching a local mullet known as pelengas. He found his fishing waders, previously used for digging up worms. He took two rubbish bags to tie around his socks, some string, and four 5-litre plastic bottles, for use as buoyancy aids. Dressed in this improvised costume, Yurin said, he set off on foot towards the beach. It was early evening. He passed ruined blocks of flats. “There were a few people out looking for water. Someone asked me for cigarettes. Otherwise the city was deserted. I took a path I knew to the seafront. It was cold.” Yurin said he waded along the sand and then plunged in. He swam out 150 metres, parallel to the shore, and started heading west. The water was freezing. “My teeth were chattering. I hid behind one of the bottles so no-one could see me. Sometimes I rested on top of the float.” He swam for two and a half hours. The 2.5-mile route took him past the Russian position at Rybatske and to the village of Melekine, which before the war was a beach resort. He staggered out. He found an elderly couple who took him in, gave him a shot of vodka and a bowl of borsch. The village was under Russian control. With the help of a neighbour, Yurin managed to board a minivan heading for the port of Berdyansk, also occupied by Russian forces. He said the Russian soldiers on the checkpoint ignored him. “They were 17 or 18 years old,” he recalled. From Berdyansk he was able to cross into Ukraine-administered territory. Diana Berg, a Mariupol resident who escaped the city, said a family had taken a similar route to Yurin’s. “Since the beach was mined they had to walk in cold water for kilometres,” she posted on Facebook. Leaving by foot through Russian positions was now impossible. “They don’t let anyone in or out,” she wrote. She added: “The city is still blocked. Every day the Russians keep ruining it with all possible weapons – air strikes, rockets, artillery, mines, tanks. Only on Wednesday there were 118 air bombs. We thought the city was destroyed already. But now it is being even more heavily ruined.” The Ukrainian army and its allied Azov battalion controlled a shrinking area in the centre of Mariupol, she said. “Civilians are trying to survive this hell. This terror is beyond imagination,” she wrote, calling for a ceasefire and evacuation organised by the international community. The government in Kyiv has accused Moscow of kidnapping thousands of Mariupol residents, including children. They were forcibly taken from city hospital number four to Russia via neighbouring pro-Russian separatist controlled areas. Video on Thursday appeared to show soldiers deporting doctors and patients at gunpoint from a city hospital. The Mariupol city council says separatists are now trundling through the ruins in a white van, collecting bodies lying on the streets. These are being burned in a mobile crematorium. The aim, it says, is to avoid the embarrassing photos that came out of Bucha, north-west of Kyiv, showing executed and bound civilians. Another Mariupol resident, Vika Dubovitskaya, said she managed to flee with her two children – Artyom, six, and Nastiya, two – in a private car. They had been sheltering in the drama theatre when the building was obliterated. “It was quiet. Then there was an explosion. We had to run,” she said. “I put my daughter on my shoulders and grabbed my son’s hand. He told me: ‘I’m tired of running’. The blast threw me against the wall. I hurt one side of my face but didn’t notice. It was the adrenalin. My only thought was to get the kids out.” Speaking from the western city of Lviv, Dubovitskaya said 1,500 people had been living inside the theatre. She said she arrived on 5 March after gas, heat, water and power inside the city were all cut off. One of the actors, Damir Sukhov, showed her a place to say on the first floor. “We were living in the corridor between classical columns. There were thick walls,” she said. Other women and children were already sleeping in the auditorium, as well as in the makeup room and in two underground cellars. The stage area was warmer but more vulnerable, she said. For the first three days there was nothing to eat. “You feel guilty when you can’t feed your kids,” she said. Ukrainian soldiers then brought food including frozen fish, which was cooked outside the building on a wood fire. Only children were allowed to eat. Volunteers looted a shop and brought warm clothes, she said. Dubovitskaya said the Russians were aware the theatre was full of women and children. They had taken over the surrounding districts and had moved surreptitiously one night into a branch of the Pumb bank, 250 metres away. Ukraine’s armed forces had painted the word “children” in giant letters outside the theatre. Later she moved to the second floor and was in the projector room when the bomb fell. It was unclear how many people died or what happened to Sukhov, the actor, who had been organising the relief effort. She was reunited on 23 March with her husband, Dmitry, who had returned from Poland to look for her and found her in a red cross camp. “There were no communications in the city. I left my phone and rucksack behind when we ran out the theatre,” she said. “Dima [Dmitry] came to the school outside Mariupol where we were living. He saw our son first but didn’t recognise him because he had lost so much weight.” The family are now camping in a basement in Lviv with 25 other refugees. Yurin, meanwhile, said his mother, who worked as a cleaner in the offices of Mariupol’s Pryazovia Worker newspaper, managed to escape a few days after his epic Azov sea swim. She was now staying with her sister in Russian-occupied Berdyansk. “What the Russians did to the theatre was an act of terror,” he said. “They knew there were peaceful people inside. They killed hundreds. It was the same story when they bombed the maternity hospital.” “He continued: “I’m 31, of fighting age. If they had got hold of me I would have been tortured and taken prisoner.” He said: “Thank God I knew the shoreline around Mariupol so well. That saved me.”"
"‘Unparalleled in intensity’ – 1,500 book bans in US school districts.",2022-04-07T14:00:04Z,Adam Gabbatt,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ye3,"More than 1,500 book bans have been instituted in US school districts in the last nine months, a study has found, part of a rightwing censorship effort described as “unparalleled in its intensity”. PEN America, a non-profit organization that works to protect freedom of expression in the US, scrutinized efforts to ban certain books from school libraries for its “Banned in the USA” report. The organization found that 1,145 books were targeted by rightwing politicians and activists, including the work of the Nobel prize laureate Toni Morrison. The report shows the striking impact of the ongoing effort by conservatives to censor literature in schools. The bans have largely targeted books that focus on race and LGBTQ issues, and a large number of the banned books are written by non-white or LGBTQ authors. PEN America tallied efforts between 1 July 2021 and 31 March this year, in what it said was the first “book by book, district by district account of what books are being banned, where in the country, and through what procedures”. It found that 1,586 bans were implemented in 86 school districts across 26 states. “This type of data has never been tallied and quite frankly the results are shocking,” said Jonathan Friedman, director of PEN America’s Free Expression and Education. “Challenges to books, specifically books by non-white male authors, are happening at the highest rates we’ve ever seen. What is happening in this country in terms of banning books in schools is unparalleled in its frequency, intensity and success.” The data confirms that was a specific theme to the book bans. Of the banned titles, 41% included “protagonists or prominent secondary characters” who were people of color, according to PEN America. About 22% of the banned books “directly address issues of race and racism”, while 33% “explicitly address LGBTQ+ themes, or have protagonists or prominent secondary characters who are LGBTQ+”. PEN America found that the three most frequently banned titles all are centered on LGBTQ+ individuals, “or touch on the topic of same-sex relationships”. Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe has been banned in 30 school districts, while All Boys Aren’t Blue by George M Johnson and Lawn Boy by Jonathan Evison are also among the most targeted. Out of Darkness by Ashley Hope Pérez, a novel about a romance between a Black teenage boy and a Mexican American girl, has been banned in 16 districts, and The Bluest Eye, the story of a young Black girl’s experiences in 1940s America by Toni Morrison, has been banned in 12 districts. “This is an orchestrated attack on books whose subjects only recently gained a foothold on school library shelves and in classrooms,” Friedman said. “We are witnessing the erasure of topics that only recently represented progress toward inclusion.” The book censorship has been matched by a wave of rightwing legislation dictating what teachers can and cannot discuss in schools. In March Florida passed a bill dubbed “don’t say gay”, which forbids “instruction” on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Some states have also banned discussion of the modern-day impact of historical racism in the US – an issue that has become a hobby horse for Republicans at state and national level. The censorship has frequently been pushed by conservative groups linked to deep-pocketed rightwing donors. Groups like Moms for Liberty and Parents Defending Education have been instrumental in book-banning attempts in the US, often presenting themselves as small, “grassroots” efforts, while in reality they have links to prominent, wealthy Republicans. There is, however, some evidence that the efforts to censor literature that focuses on race and LGBTQ issues are having the opposite effect. “Banned book clubs”, where children and young adults meet to read and discuss titles that have been censored by school districts, have sprung up across America, while sales of the book Maus, a Pulitzer prize-winning graphic novel about the Holocaust, soared in January after it was banned by a Tennessee school board."
Diabelli Variations review – Uchida’s unparalleled playing is made for this ,2022-04-07T14:00:04Z,Erica Jeal,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7egp,"It has taken until now for Mitsuko Uchida to lay down a recording of Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations. This colossal work, which grew out of a publisher’s request for one single variation on a fairly naff little tune, encapsulates so many of Beethoven’s contradictions – and Uchida, so adept at putting across music’s humour without diminishing its depth, is made for it. Her playing conveys a keen sense of the music’s absurdities without exaggerating its quirks, gently raising an eyebrow at Beethoven’s passages of deliberate heavy-footedness and revealing that there is always a sincere, profound truth right behind them. It’s not so much that her sudden changes of inflection turn the music itself around, more that she lets us see through things to what’s waiting behind. At the start, the theme bounces and bumbles along, with the downward scales at the end of each phrase jumping out at us just a little, as if the music is saying it might be up for a joke later. But in the first variation, by stressing each long chord slightly in a way that makes the music sound like it’s puffing up to the top of the keyboard, Uchida simultaneously introduces and skewers the pomposity that informs so many of the variations to come – something that dissolves, temporarily but instantly, in the delicacy of the next variation. And so it continues, with a constant thread tying the variations together through so many jack-knife changes of mood. Variation 20 sounds fascinating, all strangely modern-sounding harmonies in search of a melody; two variations later, Beethoven quotes the melody sung by Leporello in Mozart’s Don Giovanni grumbling about working night and day – was he getting fed up, or was he on a roll? – and the clarity and dexterity of Uchida’s playing here is a delight. Beethoven ends his variations, as he began, with a dance – but this delicately wrought yet expansive minuet is to that stomping little opening tune as a butterfly is to a caterpillar. In Uchida’s quietly poised hands it is at once the culmination of an entertainingly roundabout journey and the opening-up of a whole new vista. This week’s other pick The Leonore Trio’s new recording for Hyperion is of music by Woldemar Bargiel, Clara Schumann’s younger half-brother. Here are two bafflingly neglected piano trios in gloriously vibrant performances. If you’ve ever wished there was more chamber music to discover by Brahms and Robert Schumann, this is a real treat."
"Hot cross bun cookies, chocolate toasties and cake: Claire Ptak’s Easter baking recipes ",2022-04-07T14:00:04Z,Claire Ptak,https://www.theguardian.com/p/kqvj7,"At Easter, I am always in the mood for comfort baking. Madeira cake and custard, warm chocolate chip cookies, double chocolate sheet cake, oozing melted chocolate sandwiches. I make it festive with Easter spices, candied and sugared fruits, crushed up day-old hot cross buns and, of course, a little California twist. Easter sits at a time in spring when we are still waiting for strawberries to come, forced rhubarb is on the way out, outdoor rhubarb just coming in. But we have oranges, other candied citrus fruits and spices to use up. We give them a different treatment than in winter and pair them with fresh cheeses, such as ricotta, and maybe leave out the stronger cloves and darker sugars. A little orange brightens up cookies, cakes and custard making them fresh for spring. I began sugaring fruits and flowers when I started making wedding cakes more than 20 years ago. Then, I was focused on delicate rose petals, raspberries, the odd bay leaf, keeping it minimal. Now, I Iove whole fruits that look top heavy and sculptural, like Italian and French fruits made out of marble, suspended in their glittering, sugared glory. Some of the recipes take more than a day from start to finish, and some take less than an hour, so whatever your level of ambition, there is something here for you and your Easter table. Hot cross bun chocolate chip cookies (pictured above) These are my favourite chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever made. The base recipe has my signature use of egg yolks for richness but with added crunchy bits of hot cross buns and all the chocolate for texture and flavour. Make and freeze the dough, baking off individual cookies as and when you want them for optimum satisfaction and that fresh-baked cookie smell in your home. Makes 18 cookies unsalted butter 250g, softened soft brown sugar 200g white sugar 100g vanilla extract 2 tsp egg yolks 4 plain flour 315g fine sea salt 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 2 tsp stale hot cross buns 200g (2-3 buns), toasted and torn into 2cm pieces chocolate 300g, broken into different sized chunks (I use a mix of white, milk and dark. You can also use chocolate Easter eggs and random bits of bars you have, which makes it fun to eat) Line a small baking tray or baking tin (one that will fit inside your freezer) with parchment paper. Beat the butter and sugars in the bowl of an electric mixer until combined but not too creamy – you are not aiming for light and fluffy here, as that would make the cookies too cakey. Add the vanilla and the egg yolks, and mix well. In another bowl weigh out the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda, and whisk together well. Add this to the butter and egg mixture, and mix until combined. Add the hot cross bun pieces and all the chocolate chunks. Scoop individual portions of cookie dough on to the lined baking tray or tin. If using spoons, pat each portion into a little ball. Cover with clingfilm and freeze for at least 1 hour, or up to a month. When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5. Line a large baking tray with parchment paper and arrange the cookies evenly on the tray, leaving enough space between each one so they have room to expand during baking (they will almost double in size). If you are baking from frozen, allow the cookies 5 minutes out of the freezer before placing in the oven. Bake for 14 minutes or until the centre of each cookie is slightly soft and underbaked but the edges are crisp and golden. Remove from the oven, rap the tray on your counter to flatten them a little and allow to cool on the tray for 10 minutes before serving. Double chocolate sheet cake with sugared fruits Sheet cakes for gatherings are easier to portion and the ratio of icing to cake is perfect. My grandma Betty championed the sheet cake and everyone looked forward to her arrival at a picnic, foil-wrapped Pyrex dish in hand. For the sugared fruit, choose underripe fruits that are fresh and plump. I love to use odd-shaped fruits, and tropical fruits work well for a retro feel. I recommend sugaring the fruit the night before or the morning of your event. It gives the egg white a chance to set and dry out. If using berries, do them just before using or they will weep. Serves 12 For the decoration whole fruits such as small bananas, figs, prickly pears, kiwis, clementines, grapes etc egg whites 2 organic granulated sugar For the chocolate cake plain flour 200g cornflour 70g, or tapioca flour caster sugar 350g baking powder 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 1½ tsp fine sea salt 1 tsp Dutch cocoa powder 75g unsalted butter 160g water 240ml vanilla extract 1 tbsp creme fraiche or sour cream 200ml eggs 3 large For the icing dark chocolate 250g unsalted butter 180g, cut into small pieces vanilla extract 1½ tsp golden syrup 1 tbsp icing sugar 300g creme fraiche 300ml, or sour cream salt a pinch Start with the sugared fruits. You will need a pastry brush, or a small paint brush, and a cooling rack. Separate your eggs and use the yolks to make the Easter Spice custard for the madeira cake. Whisk the whites in a small bowl. Wipe the fruits with a dry cloth and lay on the cooling rack placed over a baking sheet to catch any drips and the excess sugar. One at a time, pick up a fruit and delicately brush it with the thinnest layer of egg white possible. It needs to be fully coated, but paper thin. Then, holding the brushed fruit by the stem, use your free hand to sprinkle over the granulated sugar. Work swiftly so the egg white does not dry before the sugar sticks to it. You may need to sprinkle it with the sugar a few times. Use this technique, rather than rolling the fruit into the sugar, for a finer, smoother finish. Grease and line a 23cm x 33cm oblong baking tin and set aside. Heat the oven to 150C fan/gas mark 3½. Weigh out all the dry ingredients into a large bowl, sift together twice and set aside. Melt the butter and pour into a large bowl. Add the water and vanilla to your melted butter. Whisk in the creme fraiche and finally the eggs until smooth and incorporated. Gradually whisk this into your dry ingredients until smooth, being careful not to overmix. Pour the mixture into your prepared baking tin and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a skewer inserted comes out clean and the sponge springs back to the touch. The low oven temperature allows the cake to rise slowly and evenly without peaking in the middle. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from the tin to cool completely. To make the icing, melt the chocolate, butter, vanilla and golden syrup in a bowl over barely simmering water. Scrape into a food processor and process until cool. Add the remaining ingredients and beat until smooth. Chill for 30 minutes. Transfer to a stand mixer and beat with a paddle until creamy and of a spreadable consistency – about 5 minutes. When ready to assemble the cake, place the sponge on a flat surface, such as an upturned baking sheet, or you could use a cake drum from a party store, or a lovely large serving platter. Split the cake through the middle with a large serrated knife, like a bread knife, being careful to cut evenly. Use a removable tart or cake tin base to lift the top layer off and set it aside. Fill and ice the middle, replace the top layer of cake, and ice the top and sides. Pipe a little border around the base and top edge of the cake. Chill until 30 minutes before serving. Decorate with the sugared fruits and serve immediately. Any remaining cake can be kept in the fridge for up to 5 days, but remove the sugared fruit. The sugared fruits last about 2 days – they are not really for eating but for decoration. Chocolate Easter toasties A quick home version of pain au chocolat for Easter, these can be made with hot cross buns or slices of the Italian colomba di pasquale bread, which is baked in the shape of a dove. They both make great options; hot cross buns are packed with sultanas and spices, while the colomba has candied citrus peel and is similar to panettone in flavour and texture. Serves 6 double cream 350ml dark chocolate 250g, chopped into small pieces hot cross buns 6, or a loaf of colomba di pasquale Heat 250ml of the cream gently to just under the boil (I never take my eyes off it). Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped chocolate until smooth. Sometimes this can split, so this is where your extra 100ml double cream comes in. Add cold cream little by little until the ganache is smooth. You can also use a stick blender or food processor to save a broken ganache by gradually adding the extra cold cream while the blender or processor is running. All chocolates are different so this accounts for the irregularity in results. Put the ganache in a bowl or container and place in the fridge for 30 minutes. Split the buns or slice the bread and heat a heavy bottomed frying or griddle pan over medium heat. Spread a thick layer of ganache on to your bread, staying a few millimetres in from the edge. Top with another piece and place on to your pan. Griddle on each side for just a few minutes as these sweet breads brown very fast. Be really careful when you flip it so you don’t lose too much filling. Serve straight away. Cassata with glacé fruits I first tasted a true cassata on a road trip in Sicily with my daughter when she was four. We drove for hours in 40C heat to find the famous hilltop bakery, Café Sicilia. You will need to start the day before you plan to serve this cake. Serves 10-12 caster sugar 50g water 60ml Grand Marnier 2 tbsp pistachio marzipan 200g, or green marzipan (available online and in large supermarkets) madeira cake 1 (about 900g), 1-2 days old (see recipe below) ricotta cheese 1kg, strained through a cheesecloth for 12-24 hours vanilla extract 1 tsp fine sea salt ½ tsp orange juice 1 tbsp lemon juice 3 tbsp caster sugar 100g icing sugar 250g glacé fruits such as cherries, melon, kiwi, citrus (available online and in speciality delis and food halls such as Fortnum &amp; Mason) Line a 30cm pie plate (with angled sides) with clingfilm. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the 50g of caster sugar with the water. Once dissolved, take off the heat and stir in the Grand Marnier and cool. Roll the marzipan out to about 3-4mm thickness if it is not ready rolled. Cut into strips that are the same width as the depth of your pie dish. Line the sides of your dish with the marzipan, overlapping slightly where you have to patch the strips together to form one continuous ring. Slice the madeira cake into ½cm thick slices and arrange half of them on the base of the pie plate. Drizzle half the Grand Marnier syrup evenly over the cake slices and set aside. In a large bowl whisk together the strained ricotta, vanilla, salt, orange juice, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice and the 100g of caster sugar until smooth. Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over the soaked cake and then top with the remaining cake slices, trimming where necessary to fit the dish. Drizzle over the remaining syrup and cover snugly with clingfilm. Chill for two hours. Whisk together the icing sugar and the remaining 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Invert the chilled cassata on to a serving dish, carefully removing all the clingfilm. Spoon enough of the white icing on to the top to cover, containing it within the border of the marzipan. Decorate with the glacé fruits. Refrigerate again for a further 2 hours before serving. Milk chocolate and orange milk biscuits Tender orange-flavoured biscuits sandwiched around creamy milk chocolate – these are fun to make and much easier than they look. Put them on a plate of paper doilies, like in an old-fashioned shop, to catch the sprinkles. Makes 20 sandwich biscuits plain flour 385g milk powder 100g baking powder 1 tsp fine sea salt ½ tsp unsalted butter 250g, softened cream cheese 120g oranges zest of 2 caster sugar 200g orange juice 1 tbsp vanilla pod 1, seeds scraped (save the pod for another use) egg 1 milk chocolate 300g chocolate strands or hundreds and thousands to decorate Line two large baking trays with baking parchment. Heat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4. Whisk together the dry ingredients and set aside. Cream the softened butter and cream cheese with the orange zest until smooth. Add the caster sugar, orange juice and vanilla seeds, and mix well. Add the egg, mix well and finally add the dry ingredients. Mix until just incorporated. Scoop the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a large star tip, such as Wilton No 6B. Pipe in shapes on to your prepared baking tray. I like simple oval or S shapes. Whichever shape you choose, keep them about 6cm long and be sure to pipe them in matching pairs (that reflect each other), so you can sandwich them together harmoniously. Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden. Cool for 10 minutes then turn half of them upside down. Meanwhile, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a water bath and melt gently. Or melt the chocolate in a microwave, being careful not to burn it. Using a small knife or offset spatula, spread a thin layer of chocolate on the flat side of the upturned biscuits, doing just a couple at a time so the chocolate does not set before you sandwich each cookie with their partner. Finally, use the knife to spread a swoosh of chocolate on to the end of each sandwich and sprinkle with your chocolate strands or decoration of choice. Serve in flattened cupcake cases or on a plate lined with paper doilies. They will keep in an airtight container for a week. Madeira cake with Easter spice custard This madeira cake is my attempt at a supermarket classic. It gets the soft brown crust just right and, soaked in warm, delicately spiced custard, I dare you not to eat two portions. The lavender and rose is optional but I really recommend trying it. Mixed with the citrus and spice, it all comes together in an unusual yet beautifully balanced silky custard delight. Makes one large loaf (6-8 portions) For the cake unsalted butter 150g, softened vegetable oil 50ml caster sugar 200g eggs 4 large plain flour 200g cornflour 50g, or tapioca flour baking powder 2 tsp sea salt ¼ tsp whole milk 120ml For the custard (makes about 600ml, enough for the 6-8 portions) Ceylon cinnamon ½ stick nutmeg a few fresh grates vanilla pod ½ orange peel 1 strip (use a potato peeler to get a few strips from each, avoiding as much of the white pith as possible) lemon peel 1 strip lime peel 1 strip lavender buds a sprinkle (optional) dried rose petals a sprinkle (optional) whole milk 250ml double cream 250ml sugar 75g sea salt a pinch egg yolks 3 Grand Marnier a splash (optional) Butter and line a 1kg loaf tin with baking parchment and set aside. Heat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter, oil and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder and salt. Add half of the mixture to the butter-sugar mixture and beat well. Add half the milk and beat well, repeating with the remaining dry mixture and milk. Scrape the bottom of the bowl to make sure nothing is stuck there, mix a final time. Tip the mixture into your prepared baking tin and tap on the counter a few times to remove large air bubbles. Bake until golden, a skewer inserted comes out clean, and the madeira cake is springy to the touch – about 45-50 minutes. While the cake is cooling, you can make the custard. I love to serve the custard hot, just cooked with the freshly baked cake, but both will last well for up to 5 days and can be eaten cold, room temperature or reheated. Basically, any which way you eat this cake and custard combo is delicious. To make the custard, put all the ingredients except the egg yolks and Grand Marnier in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Bring to just under the boil, turn off the heat, cover with a lid and steep for at least 20 minutes. Place the egg yolks in a large bowl (save the whites for the sugared fruits or another use) and place a fine sieve over the bowl. Pour the steeped cream over the yolks and discard the spices. Whisk together the yolks and milk mixture until smooth. Rinse out the saucepan before pouring the custard back in. Place over a medium-low heat and whisk continuously until the custard is thick. Remove and decant into a jug or bowl and add the Grand Marnier, if using. If not using straight away, put it in an airtight container and leave at room temperature for up to 2 hours or chill.

Trump says he regrets not marching on Capitol with supporters on January 6 ,2022-04-07T13:45:34Z,Oliver Laughland,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7znd,"Donald Trump has said he regrets not marching on the US Capitol building with his supporters on the day of the January 6 insurrection and again rejected suggestions he used “burner phones” on the day of the assault. In a defiant interview with the Washington Post the former president said he had pressed to march with his supporters on January 6, but was blocked from doing so by Secret Service agents. “Secret Service said I couldn’t go. I would have gone there in a minute,” Trump told the Post, later bragging about the size of the “tremendous crowd” at the “Save America” rally that day. Last month CBS News and the Post revealed internal White House phone records from the day of the attack on the Capitol showed a seven-hour-and-37-minute gap in Trump’s phone logs including the period in which the assault occurred. The reports revealed the House committee investigating the attack were examining whether Trump had used burner phones – disposable mobile phones – during that period. Trump has denied doing so and said he did not know the meaning of the term, but last week his former national security adviser John Bolton said the former president had used the term several times in conversations. In his interview with the Washington Post, Trump again denied use of burner phones and said he had not destroyed any call logs. He claimed instead he had not received many phone calls on the day of the assault, but remembered talking to two Republican congressmen, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Jim Jordan. “From the standpoint of telephone calls, I don’t remember getting very many,” he told the Post, later adding, “Why would I care about who called me? If congressmen were calling me, what difference did it make? There was nothing secretive about it. There was no secret.” Trump also acknowledged he had communicated with Ginni Thomas, wife of the conservative supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, during his presidency but said he was not aware of her lobbying around the 2020 election results. Text messages obtained by the Washington Post and received by the 6 January committee, revealed Ginni Thomas had repeatedly lobbied Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to push to keep Trump in power after Joe Biden won the election. “First of all, her husband is a great justice. And she’s a fine woman. And she loves our country,” Trump said in his interview with the Post. The former president also said he had not been contacted by the 6 January committee and offered no clear indication of how he would respond if contacted. He branded his daughter Ivanka’s appearance before the committee earlier this week as “shame and harassment” but told the Post he was not aware of what she had said. The interview came as the committee received a cache of 101 emails belonging to the Trump lawyer John Eastman, which are likely to reveal details of the efforts undertaken to block former vice-president Mike Pence from certifying the election result in Congress on 6 January. On Wednesday the House also voted to hold two former senior Trump aides, Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas issues by the committee, paving the way for potential criminal prosecution."
"UK embassy guard gave secrets to Russian general, court told",2022-04-07T13:32:43Z,Tobi Thomas,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zf7,"A security guard at the British embassy in Berlin accused of spying for Russia allegedly passed “secret” information about the government to a Russian military attache, a court heard. David Smith, 57, denied nine offences under the Official Secrets Act when he appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday. The Briton, who was living in Potsdam in the German capital, is accused of gathering information from the embassy and passing it to someone he believed was a representative of the Russian state, as well as other alleged offences, between October 2020 and August last year. During his appearance Smith spoke only to give his full name, age and address, and to submit his plea of not guilty. The court heard the charges included the allegation that Smith tried to communicate by letter with Gen Maj Sergey Chukhurov, a Russian military person based in the Russian embassy in Berlin. The court was told the material in the letter allegedly contained “details about the activities, identities, addresses and telephone numbers of various members of Her Majesty’s civil service”, in breach of the Official Secrets Act. Regarding the other eight charges, Smith is accused of committing acts “prejudicial” to the safety and interest of the state by gathering information classified as “secret” about the “activities of Her Majesty’s government” and that he “collected material relating to the operation and layout of the British embassy in Berlin, and that information was calculated to be or might be or was intended to be directly or be indirectly useful to an enemy, namely the Russian state”. He is also alleged to have made unauthorised photocopies of documents, video recordings of the embassy’s CCTV system and kept sim card packaging he had been asked to dispose of. Smith also allegedly communicated information about building repairs at the embassy after being “approached by a person you believed to be a member of Russian military intelligence (the GRU)”. All charges carry a maximum sentence of 14 years. Smith was denied bail and remanded in custody. He was extradited to the UK from Germany on Wednesday after his arrest by German police on 10 August 2021. Scotland Yard said the investigation was led by counter-terrorism officers. Nick Price, the head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division at the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “David Smith has been charged with nine offences contrary to the Official Secrets Act. “He is accused of seven offences of collecting information with the intent of sending it to the Russian authorities, one of attempting communication, and one of providing information to a person he believed was a member of the Russian authorities. “After reviewing the case and authorising charges, we obtained an extradition warrant and worked closely with our German counterparts in order to bring Mr Smith back to the UK.”"
What is non-domicile status and who qualifies?,2022-04-07T11:10:55Z,Kalyeena Makortoff,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ntf,"What is non-domicile status? A person who is registered as non-domiciled with HM Revenue and Customs is tax resident in the UK but does not have to pay UK tax on income and capital gains earned overseas – including on company stocks or cash made from selling a second home – unless they bring their money into the UK or deposit it into a UK bank account. However, non-doms do still have to pay tax on money earned within the UK. Who qualifies as a non-dom resident? A person with non-dom status is someone who lives in the UK and is tax resident here, but who has their permanent home outside the country. They must demonstrate to HMRC that their domicile – at least for tax purposes – is in another country. Usually their domicile will be the country that their father considered their permanent home when they were born, and to which they intend to eventually return, perhaps when they retire. Because they are tax resident in the UK, non-doms will typically not be tax resident in their country of domicile, and therefore not liable for tax in either country on their worldwide income. Non-doms have to specifically apply for a tax exemption on foreign income of more than £2,000, meaning it is not an automatic designation for foreign-born residents or non-citizens. How long does the non-dom tax break last? After a certain amount of time, non-doms must pay a hefty charge in order to continue sheltering their foreign income from UK tax. Those who have been living in the UK for at least seven of the previous nine tax years must pay £30,000 a year to the government. Those who have lived in the UK for 12 of the previous 14 tax years must pay £60,000 a year. UK residents must pay tax on their worldwide earnings once they have been in the country for 15 of the previous 20 years. Foreign nationals who are resident in the UK can choose to pay British taxes at any point on their worldwide income and capital gains. They do not have to hold a UK passport to be taxed here. Why is it controversial? The rule primarily benefits the very rich, and has allowed those claiming it to avoid paying significant sums to HMRC. A study by the London School of Economics and the University of Warwick found that more than two-fifths of people who earned £5m or more in 2018 had claimed non-dom status at some point since 1997. Some of the highest earning non-doms work in the film industry and sport, including famous actors, directors, producers and Premier League football players, according to the report, which also found that 22% of top-earning bankers have benefited from the scheme. Which big names have claimed UK non-dom status? Some of the most well-known people who have reportedly claimed non-dom status include Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch and owner of Chelsea football club now under sanctions, the steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal and the media baron and Daily Mail owner, Lord Rothermere. Lord Ashcroft, the multimillionaire and former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, and the former HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver were also reported to have used the non-dom scheme. The same applied to Sir James Goldsmith and his children, including the Conservative minister and longtime friend of Boris Johnson, Zac Goldsmith. What about the chancellor’s wife? It emerged on Wednesday that Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, claims non-dom status, allowing her to potentially save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. Murty’s father is the billionaire founder of the Indian-headquartered company Infosys, in which she holds a 0.9% stake. Her non-dom status means she is not liable to pay the 39.35% tax applied to dividend payouts for UK-resident taxpayers in the highest income band. A spokesperson for Murty confirmed she has opted to pay the £30,000 annual levy so that she is not taxed in the UK on her foreign income. The Guardian estimates Murty has collected £54.5m (5.4bn Indian rupees) in dividends from Infosys since 2015, the earliest date for which the relevant information is available. Had she been paying UK tax on that income, she would have been liable for as much as £20m. She may not avoid UK tax indefinitely. Under current law, Murty will automatically be deemed domiciled after living in the UK for a total of 15 years. Murty, who married Sunak in 2009, soon after they met while she was studying for a master’s in business administration at Stanford University in Silicon Valley, is understood to have moved to the UK in 2015. Her tax arrangement is legal and it is understood the chancellor declared his wife’s status to the Cabinet Office when he took office in 2018. A spokesperson for Murty has said she “has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income”. However, Labour has criticised Sunak for imposing tax increases on working households while his wife benefits from a scheme that has tended to help the wealthiest in the UK avoid national levies."
Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – going beyond the chaise longue on nuanced debut,2022-04-07T13:16:34Z,Rachel Aroesti,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nhb,"The novelty song is a dying art form. Deliberately silly, often profoundly annoying earworms by unestablished artists rarely factor into today’s pop universe. Instead, they have been replaced by the viral hit: a song by a nascent star that swiftly rises from obscurity to ubiquity, sating the appetite for newness and surprise with a bit more coolness and class. Although the viral hit is implicitly attention-grabbing, it doesn’t tend to be gimmicky – usually the accompanying social media craze (TikTok dance, or back in the day, Twitter meme template) takes care of that. Occasionally, there comes a viral hit that dances on the edge of novelty territory – comedic, a bit weird and infuriatingly catchy – but, crucially, not without serious musical panache. In 2019, that song was Old Town Road, the country-trap smash by Nicki Minaj stan turned musician Lil Nas X. Last year, it was minimalist indie number Chaise Longue by Isle of Wight duo Wet Leg, AKA late twentysomethings Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers. Over a monotonous bass line and sirening post-punk riff, a deadpan Teasdale intoned a series of non sequiturs – from suggestive Mean Girls quotes (“would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?”) to suggestive allusions to academia (“I went to school and I got the big D”). The chorus – essentially, “on the Chaise Longue” repeated ad infinitum in staccato style – combined with the vaguely gross-out band name sealed its strange, adolescent appeal. At 13m Spotify streams, the numbers aren’t exactly at Drivers License levels (that particular viral hit is on more than 1.3bn streams), but the hype Chaise Longue has generated on both sides of the Atlantic is far from negligible – they came second in the BBC’s influential Sound of 2022 poll and have appeared on several late-night US chatshows. Yet there is a price to pay for such teasing flamboyance. Firstly, you risk being seen as an irritant – I can’t be the only one who found Chaise Longue’s irreverence rather ersatz, and its supposedly witty innuendoes more like sub-Carry On inanity. Secondly, you introduce a certain amount of scepticism towards your first proper body of work. Are Wet Leg just a flash in the pan? While their eponymous debut album will no doubt disappoint fans of endless double entendres, it may just convert the cynics. Much like Lil Nas X did with his debut, the pair don’t repeat the style of their brash breakthrough hit, but have instead produced a far more subtle and conventional record. Wet Leg – mostly recorded in cocoon-like circumstances before Chaise Longue’s release, with help from producer du jour Dan Carey (Black Midi, Fontaines DC) – is a collection of 90s and 00s-era indie that is by turns dreamy, lush, hooky and thunderous, and layered with lyrics saturated with millennial disaffection, anxiety and overwhelm. The tracks that bookend the album are among the best examples of this approach: opener Being in Love – in which a satisfyingly original twist on the idea of infatuation as mental instability is relayed through the medium of scuzzy/delicate rock – and closer Too Late Now, a stormy tribute to opportunities passing you by and alienation setting in. The latter has a gratifyingly relatable self-doubt break, when the music drops out to allow Teasdale to document her existential angst as it spreads into the track she is currently performing: “I’m not sure if this is a song / I don’t even know what I’m saying … I’m not sure if this is the kind of life that I saw myself living.” The quarter-life crisis – rendered in messy, anxiety-riven, circular thought patterns – is perhaps the unifying motif of Wet Leg. On the psychedelic I Don’t Wanna Go Out, whose recurring riff nods to Bowie’s The Man Who Sold the World, our narrator is “almost 28, still getting off my stupid face.” On Angelica, sourly chiming guitars soundtrack a woman miserably going through the motions at a party; Oh No reflects on the infinite scroll while only just managing to suppress screeching panic. There are more in-yer-face tracks – with its hummed bass line and ambling raucousness, Supermarket’s tale of being stoned while doing the big shop recalls first-wave British punk in spirit and subject matter, while Wet Dream archly rejects the idea of being the object of masturbatory fantasies – but there is a maudlin air to these, too. The music is more muted and bittersweet than on Chaise Longue, as are the jokes – which actually make sense this time. That Teasdale and Chambers are able to treat great lines like throwaway remarks – as on the sweetly incantatory Loving You, which features the jibe: “I hope you choke on your girlfriend” – is proof they have wit to spare. You have to concede that in the content-saturated streaming age, arriving with a bit of goonish novelty probably isn’t a bad way to kickstart a career. Wet Leg have certainly got people listening, and by channelling their sense of humour and showmanship into a series of tracks that are far more nuanced and three-dimensional than the infuriatingly repetitive song that made their name, they’ve ensured their debut album is well worth hearing – again and again and again."
Johnson’s energy security strategy won’t bring down our eye-watering heating bills,2022-04-07T13:14:03Z,Eleanor Salter,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z69,"At last, the energy security strategy has been published, after weeks of hedging, briefing and delays. The original aims of the strategy, which was initially promised on 7 March, were worthy: to confront rocketing energy bills and transition away from Russian fossil fuels after the invasion of Ukraine. There was also hope in the climate world that the strategy would go further and faster in the transition to a zero-carbon economy. The cost of renewables has tumbled, and the UK’s leaky housing stock is crying out for retrofitting. This was an opportunity for an urgent response both to the climate and cost of living crises. But for something that was motivated by a war and an energy crisis, the headline policies of the resulting document strikingly fail to address either. One of the cornerstone issues is timescale: the strategy is big on infrastructure commitments such as new nuclear power plants and offshore wind farms, which won’t be fully operational for years, if not decades. Radical reform of the planning system to allow more onshore wind, one of the quickest and cheapest short-term salves to high energy bills, is absent. In its place there is a milquetoast commitment to “consulting on developing partnerships for a limited number of supportive communities”. Months after Cop26, the strategy has committed to licensing and drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea. Its climate ambitions are therefore deeply questionable. The majority of this oil is tagged for export; as Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, pointed out, domestic production won’t address energy bills but will only help fossil fuel executives get richer. Without nationalisation, new oil and gas will be sold at the market rate. Shell made a profit of $19.3bn (£14.7bn) last year. Other energy companies have also been raking it in, benefiting from the extortionate price of gas. Instead of imposing a windfall tax on these oil and gas companies that could help fund energy saving measures, the government’s strategy does the precise opposite. New oil and gas could blow a gigantic hole in the UK’s carbon budget. Licensing new exploration is a brazen move even for the Johnson government, committing to oil and gas in the same week as the devastating IPCC report confirmed existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure will far exceed the 1.5C limit. This rushed energy security strategy, which is likely to be incompatible with the government’s other stated climate targets of net zero by 2050, is what happens when you push policies through the weird prism of the Tory party. Although the Johnson administration is no stranger to disorder, producing the energy security strategy has been chaos on a new scale. Over the past few weeks, the prime minister has been attempting to put out multiple fires across his party. Headlines have been peppered with briefings and counter-briefings. On 23 March, the Guardian trailed that Johnson would champion onshore wind in defiance of his Nimby backbenchers. A mere fortnight later, he apparently backed away from onshore wind after over 100 backbenchers lobbied against the policy. As a result, the new strategy has something for everyone, but pleases no one. A new survey into fracking has been ordered as bait to the Tory right, with Kwarteng claiming the government will be “guided by the science on shale gas”. But little has changed in the UK’s geology since the moratorium on fracking was enforced in 2019. Another problem with this strategy is deeply familiar. While it presents a bundle of promises, there is no money to back these up. The key phrase to look out for is “up to”. Nuclear power could provide “up to 24GW by 2050”. The government will “look to increase the UK’s current 14GW of solar capacity which could grow up to 5 times by 2035”. Even “we would like to see up to 5GW from floating offshore wind”. These are not targets, they are vague intimations. The energy strategy is silent on one fundamental issue – reducing energy demand. Widely reported wrangling between the Treasury, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Number 10 is to blame. Energy efficiency measures are the quickest and cheapest way to lower energy bills and end reliance on Russian fossil fuels. They are also necessary for decarbonisation. But the Treasury blocked a proposal to expand the Energy Company Obligation scheme, which provides insulation measures to low-income households. This spat seemed petty to the point of ridicule: departments are bickering over a £200m top-up to an existing policy when an enormous, nationwide retrofit campaign will be both necessary and inevitable as our planet warms. The problem is not only of ideological difference, but also ideological vacuum. Most civil servants had no idea a strategy was even in the pipeline when Johnson promised it four weeks ago. But a frenzy in Whitehall to make up policy on the hoof has become a common trait of this government, whose manifesto was slender and whose party consensus is messy on almost every issue. Coordination across the cabinet is beyond Johnson’s reach, partly because he is weak and partly because he doesn’t know what he stands for. In 2012, he called wind turbines “white satanic mills” whose “collective oomph wouldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding”. Now, he’s blowing hard for offshore wind. Johnson finds himself up against a popular, anti-spend chancellor and the Net Zero Scrutiny Group. Despite his 80-seat majority, he is unable to convince his backbenchers of the need for swift commitments to the cost-of-living and climate crises, whilst we career towards 3.2C warming. He has to squeeze everything past a reticent chancellor and a party whose backbenchers are a decade behind public opinion. The result is a mash of promised policies which don’t tackle the issue of energy security. Without seriously contemplating a reduction in our energy demand or fast-tracking renewables, the strategy simply does not address what it was created for in the first place – ending dependence on a belligerent Russia, and bringing down eye-watering bills. Instead, the ragged Tory consensus is to deliver high-intensity infrastructure at some indefinite point in the future, and a failure to rise to the urgency required on energy for both people and planet.

Ali Harbi Ali tells court he did not feel shame after killing David Amess,2022-04-07T13:08:57Z,Jamie Grierson,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z46,"The man accused of murdering Conservative MP Sir David Amess has told a court he did not have “any shame” as he admitted to killing the Conservative MP because he had voted seven years ago in support of a military campaign in Syria. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, stabbed Amess more than 20 times with a foot-long carving knife at Belfairs Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, shortly after midday on 15 October 2021, the Old Bailey heard. Telling the court he considered himself to be a “moderate Muslim”, he said he had previously hoped to kill Michael Gove, now the levelling up secretary. He denies preparing terrorist acts and murder. Dressed all in black, the bespectacled defendant told jurors: “I decided to do it because I felt that if I could kill someone who made decisions to kill Muslims, it could prevent further harm to those Muslims.” Ali said Amess had previously voted along with other MPs in support of airstrikes on Islamic State-controlled territories in Syria, a vote that took place in 2015 under the former prime minister David Cameron. Cross-examined by Tom Little QC, Ali was asked what difference killing Amess would make. He replied: “For one, he can’t vote again. “If he had previous for doing votes like that he won’t do it in the future, and perhaps send a message to his colleagues.” Little put it to Ali that on the day of the attack, Amess was trying to help him. Ali replied: “Oh, because of the surgery? I guess, yes. I killed him because he harmed Muslims. If he helped me after that [voting on Syrian airstrikes] then it doesn’t really matter.” Little said: “He posed no risk at all to you.” Ali replied: “He posed risk to Muslims.” He agreed that Amess’s membership of the Conservative Friends of Israel group was another “big problem” for him. Ali admitted he had previously been asked why he had a note on his phone about his “plans” to kill Gove. Ali said: “That was plans I had to attack and hopefully kill Michael Gove at the time. I believe he was someone who was a harm to Muslims. I thought if I couldn’t go join Islamic State, I should try and do something here to help Muslims here.” Ali told the court he had no regrets over killing Sir David, who he referred to as simply “David”. He denied being “utterly shameless”. He said: “I wouldn’t use the word ‘shameless’ but I don’t have any shame.” Little said: “You don’t think you did anything wrong.” And Ali replied: “If I thought I did anything wrong, I wouldn’t have done it.” Ali said he “deeply” regretted not being able to join Islamic State and did not think the attack was wrong. I consider myself a Muslim who went out and killed someone who killed Muslims,” he said. Asked if he regarded himself as a radical, he replied: “I am a moderate Muslim.” Ali had managed to arrange an appointment with Amess, 69, by telling the politician’s office he was a healthcare worker moving to the area and wished to discuss local matters. The trial previously heard how Ali allegedly spent years hatching his plot, researching a number of potential high-profile political targets including Gove, Dominic Raab and Sir Keir Starmer, before settling on Amess. Describing his childhood, Ali told the jury it was “full of love and care”. “I had a big family who used to come around all the time,” he said. “I don’t recall any bad memories at the time.” He told the jury he dropped out of university as he felt “as a Muslim” he was obliged to do something during a period when there was fighting in Syria. “I felt I was railroading myself into a normal life,” he said. The trial continues."
"At the Trump rally in Michigan, talk of a stolen election still holds sway",2022-04-07T13:00:04Z,Sam Levine in New York,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ydy,"Hello, and happy Thursday, Last Saturday, I spent the day at Donald Trump’s rally in Washington, Michigan, a suburb about 45 minutes north of Detroit. The former president was in Michigan to rally for Kristina Karamo and Matthew DePerno, two little-known Republican candidates running for secretary of state and attorney general respectively. Both have never held elected office and have fashioned their entire political identity by spreading misinformation about the 2020 election. If elected, both would wield considerable influence over the rules of how ballots in Michigan, a critical battleground state, are cast and counted. For the last year, my colleague Ed Pilkington and I have been closely following how Trump and allies are trying to take over or get elected to offices that have more control over election rules (you can read Ed’s recent profile of Karamo here). In Michigan, Republicans have appointed people who have embraced the idea of a stolen election to local boards of canvassers, which certify election results. With those positions filled, and Trump loyalists like Karamo and DePerno holding statewide office, many see a clear effort to put pieces in places to block a Democrat from being declared the winner of the next presidential election. I wanted to know whether people at the rally continued to believe the election was stolen, and whether there was anything that could convince them otherwise. More than 250 local audits have affirmed the results in Michigan. A Republican-led review by the legislature has also debunked Trump’s claims of fraud. From the moment I got to the rally on Saturday morning, I saw the strategy of focusing on election machinery on display. Over and over, I heard many people being solicited to become election workers. That included two men I was interviewing as they waited in line. “You guys think we’re gonna have a fair election?” a canvasser with a clipboard asked Christian Howard, 25, and Marco Braggion, 26. “We need to keep eyes on what’s going on. If we don’t have eyes on it, they’re gonna do what they want,” he said. When both men declined to sign up – one was from out of state and the other couldn’t get time off work – the canvasser didn’t give up. He asked them if they knew anyone else who might be interested. Another group was trying to get people to sign a petition to “decertify” the 2020 election in Michigan, something that is not possible. Inside the rally, organizers placed a petition that would tighten voting rules in the state on every single seat. It wasn’t until the end of the day that I realized that for all of the petition signing and election worker signing, I hadn’t heard anyone asking people if they wanted to sign up to register to vote. A few people had heard of either DePerno or Karamo, but it was clear that Trump’s endorsement was elevating the two candidates. “Trump endorsed them, that got my attention. So I’m here to see that,” said Diane Zechmeister, 67, who traveled from nearby Oxford to the rally. Nearly everyone I spoke to who believed the 2020 election was stolen said it would be nearly impossible to convince them otherwise. “Not with what I’ve seen. I really, I just can’t see that,” said Greg Taylor, 38. “The only way that we could know is, I guess, through an audit, I guess. But who knows about the audit?” he said. “It’s so hard to trust anybody. I don’t trust either side, you know.” I asked Taylor where he gets his news from and he told me Telegram, the popular messaging app, where there are concerns about the spread of misinformation. Wayne Wallace, 58, said he had been voting in the same precinct in Arenac county for years, but when he and his wife went to vote in 2020 there were several people he didn’t recognize. “It all seemed shady and sheisty, and now I understand how it could have happened,” he told me. “I don’t run elections. I just know bullshit when I see it.” He also noted Trump had warned for months about vote totals changing in the middle of the night, which wound up happening in 2020. Election officials and experts had warned it would take longer than usual to count votes in 2020 because of the influx of mail-in ballots and that vote totals could change. And he said he remained unconvinced by the multitude of audits Michigan did to affirm the election results. “It’s not in the vote. It’s in who counted the vote,” he said. Also worth watching … A federal judge didn’t just strike down several new voting restrictions in Florida last week, but went even further and said the state had to pre-clear certain voting changes with his court for the next 10 years. Florida is appealing. Trump allies are pushing to have jurisdictions count ballots by hand, something experts warn is prone to error and could be a “recipe for some chaos”. Ohio officials are again making the case to the state supreme court for why they shouldn’t be held in contempt for ignoring previous orders to make the state’s legislative districts less distorted in favor of Republicans. Texas rejected nearly 25,000 mail-in ballots in its 1 March primary, meaning the state had a staggeringly high 12.38% rejection rate. Several Republican-led states have made it illegal to receive outside funding for elections, which will make it harder for local election offices to serve voters."
I test-drove the all-electric Hummer. Can it win over America’s EV skeptics?,2022-04-07T13:00:03Z,"Oliver Milman in Phoenix, Arizona",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7htp,"It is the weight of an elephant, can move like a crab and in a previous life was reviled by environmentalists. The Hummer, that avatar of gas-guzzling machismo, has returned as an electric vehicle with an unlikely billing as an ally in the effort to avert the worsening climate crisis. The reincarnation of the hulking pickup truck, test-driven by the Guardian in the searing heat of Arizona, has been lauded by manufacturer General Motors (GM) as proof that electric vehicles (EVs) can now reach even middle America’s most obdurate devotees of supersized car culture. GM hopes to crush, under a brawny Hummer wheel, the notion that green cars must look like a Prius. “We want to turn EV skeptics into EV believers,” said Mikhael Farah, a GM spokesperson. This Hummer has even been endorsed as a climate boon by the White House – in November, Joe Biden screeched around GM’s Detroit plant in a Hummer EV. “This sucker is something else!” the president, a self-confessed “car guy”, exclaimed. It’s a startling reframing of a brand that was spawned from a spartan, military-grade Humvee and became a sort of muscular invading force on roads in the early 2000s. Arnold Schwarzenegger, before he started issuing earnest warnings about climate change, championed it. Boxy and unrefined, the Hummer embodied an outlandishly masculine aesthetic that seemed to almost revel in its gargantuan fuel consumption. Even in an era when the size of cars has been put on steroids, concerns over the climate crisis made the Hummer a standout, cartoonish villain. In 2003, dozens of Hummers were vandalized and set on fire by environmentalists in Los Angeles, with many of the vehicles spray-painted with the words ‘‘gross polluter’’ and ‘‘fat, lazy Americans”. In 2010, the Hummer was discontinued. The electric resurrection of the Hummer, first announced in 2020, has produced a vehicle that does not emit the carbon pollution that overheats the planet nor many of the other toxins that routinely kill thousands of Americans, and millions worldwide, who inhale befouled air. But in many ways it still pushes the boundaries of absurdity. The vehicle weighs more than 4.5 tons, a bulk closer to that of a small bulldozer than the sort of cars typically seen on American streets a decade or so ago. The huge Ultium battery that powers the vehicle is nearly 3,000lb, about the same as two grand pianos. The wheels look like they could traverse Mars. The big display panel in the chunky interior of the Hummer does, indeed, show a graphic of the car on Mars when you put it in its off-road mode. Most trips are on roads, of course – almost half of car journeys in US cities are three miles or less – meaning Hummer drivers will be piloting a metal behemoth weighing the same as a young blue whale when popping out to get some milk. “The Hummer is a niche statement of excess,” according to Daniel Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. The price of the first Hummer EV iteration – subsequent models will be cheaper – is a princely $110,000. About 66,000 people have put in an order for a pickup or SUV version of the Hummer and while GM says most have never owned an EV before, many are also simply adding it as a second or third vehicle, somewhat negating the climate benefits. “It’s huge, it’s terribly expensive and it doesn’t fit every lifestyle,” said Carla Bailo, chief executive of the Center for Automotive Research. “GM won’t overproduce it because there’s a limited base of people who will want it.” On its own terms, however, the Hummer EV is an adroit piece of engineering. Fully charged, the battery will propel the vehicle 329 miles before a top-up is needed. The Hummer is smoothly powerful in rocky terrain, with the test drive showcasing its ability to effortlessly traverse plunging, pitted trails in the cacti-dotted desert west of Phoenix. The task is aided by a wealth of technology – the Hummer has 18 different camera angles from below and around the vehicle you can view via the screen, as well as an innovation called “crabwalk”, where each of the tires are set at a 10-degree angle to allow for a sort of sliding, diagonal movement to manoeuvre away from precipitous edges of tracks. On the flat there is raw pace, too, with the instant response of electric acceleration hurling the Hummer forward from a standstill to 60mph in three seconds, a speed that can cause passengers and drivers alike to emit a yelp of surprise. Inside, the Hummer EV is more comfortable than the original and features designs of the moon’s topography – a nod to GM’s role in creating a lunar-roving buggy, which of course was electric – but it maintains a certain butch aesthetic. This points to the Hummer’s broader significance – a demonstration that electric vehicles can now provide the sheer power, size and sensibilities that US buyers cherish, even if they still command only a small fraction of sales. “What we wanted to do is get a truck buyer who would never buy an EV in his life, or never even think about it,” said Brian Malczewski, a chief exterior designer of the new Hummer. “We’re hoping to get, finally, the truck buyers who may be the hardest people to get into this space. This is the perfect conduit for that, I think.” GM is not alone in attempting this. Ford has announced an electric version of its F-150 truck, which has been the best-selling vehicle in America since Ronald Reagan was president, Tesla has its much-hyped Cybertruck and newcomers such as Rivian have garnered plenty of attention. At a different end of the market, you will even be able to get an electric Maserati this year, even if the price, like many EVs, is eye-watering. “I think electric power trains for heavier work trucks, SUVs and pickups, like the Hummer, will be amazing,” said Chris Gearhart, director of NREL’s Center for Integrated Mobility Sciences. “The torque profile of an electric motor will give these vehicles a lot of towing power, and the potential for using some of the electrical power in the batteries to directly power worksites and provide backup power could make these vehicles incredibly useful.” While EV options are expanding, it’s still unclear whether production levels, and sales, will ramp up with the urgency of the climate crisis. GM has vowed to sell 1m EVs in 2025 before going all-electric a decade later but delivered only 26 electric cars to customers in the final quarter of last year. Toyota wants to sell 3.5m EVs annually by 2030 but currently has none for sale in the US. Public charging infrastructure, meanwhile, remains spotty across the US and Biden’s attempt to fund 500,000 new chargers has yet to be fulfilled by Congress. Phasing out gasoline cars by 2035, which the US must do if it is reach net zero emissions by 2050 and help avoid climate catastrophe, remains a steep challenge but several experts say replacing them with similar electric alternatives will be the quickest, and most pragmatic, way of slashing emissions from car-dominated American life. “EVs are by far the best and most economic way to reduce greenhouse gases in transportation,” said Sperling. He added that better public transport, cycle paths and denser housing would be beneficial too but these actions are “far less important for reducing greenhouse gases, at lease in the US and other affluent car-centric countries”. Others argue for a more fundamental change that moves people out of cars altogether, rather than simply replacing one type of large vehicle with another. Last month, Harvey Miller was crossing the road in Columbus, Ohio, when he was knocked to the ground by an SUV, leaving him bruised. Miller said the “mortified” driver, who said she hadn’t seen him, fortunately stopped the car before crushing him to death. Miller was walking home from Ohio State University’s campus where, ironically, he teaches classes on transportation safety and urban mobility. The incident underlined to him the lingering problems of America’s fixation upon wide highways, sprawling suburbs and huge vehicles, even if EVs do become the norm. SUVs are far more likely to kill pedestrians than cars, research has found, due to blind spots from the elevated seating position and bulky front ends that strike people high in the torso and head rather than lower in the body. Their ubiquity in American life can also crowd out or scare away those seeking other ways of getting around. “The Hummer scares me – it’s massive and not compatible with life in cities,” Miller said, adding that SUVs also can be dangerous. “These large vehicles use up a lot of space and are expensive. I’m disappointed that Biden is championing them and not other forms of mobility, such as walking and biking infrastructure. Cars should fill in the niches for some people, not be the default. “I’m not against EVs – they are the future, but you’ve got to support buses, walking and cycling too or it’s like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. People need options. Unfortunately, car culture is so ingrained that even painting a bike path can get a huge amount of pushback.”"
Transgender cyclist Emily Bridges set for lottery funding if allowed to compete,2022-04-07T13:00:03Z,Sean Ingle,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zk7,"UK Sport says it will support the transgender cyclist Emily Bridges with lottery funding in the buildup to the Paris 2024 Olympics if she is allowed to compete in the women’s category. The confirmation by the funding body for British Olympic and Paralympic sport came less than 24 hours after Boris Johnson said he did not believe “biological men should be competing in female sport events”. The UK Sport chief executive, Sally Munday, said Bridges would be entitled to public funding up to £27,000 a year, plus benefits, if world cycling’s governing body, the UCI, allows her to compete as a woman and praised her “incredible resilience”. “We will support every or any athlete who a sport or governing body has deemed to have future potential and is eligible to compete,” said Munday. “I have huge empathy for everyone involved in this. I have huge empathy for Emily. I have huge empathy for the women whom she would have been potentially competing against. “Emily has shown incredible courage, incredible resilience and huge determination. When you are in the centre of something which is of national interest, which this has become, then clearly that creates a pressure and environment on any individual. But this isn’t simply about Emily. This is a much bigger topic.” Bridges, who set a national junior men’s record over 25 miles in 2018, had hoped to race as a woman for the first time at the British National Omnium Championships last Saturday before she was barred by the UCI, which questioned whether she was eligible. That ruling came after Bridges’s competitors held talks about boycotting the event in protest against the UCI’s transgender rules that require trans women to lower their testosterone to five nmol/L for a year. The riders believe the current guidelines are insufficient to stop anyone who has been through male puberty having a major advantage in the women’s category, a position supported by Sara Symington, the head of Great Britain’s Olympic cycling programme, who has signed a letter to the UCI calling for a rule change. Munday said UK Sport had been in regular talks with British Cycling to make sure Bridges was receiving support, along with the riders who threatened a boycott. “We must not lose sight of the fact that this is much bigger than a single person,” Munday said. “And we have to have these conversations respectfully because humans, human feelings and human experiences are at the centre of this.” Munday dismissed suggestions that Johnson’s comments on transgender athletes would change the funding template for UK Sport, as it was up to individual sports to decide who was eligible to compete. “What is really important is that we make sure as a sporting industry we are inclusive, that we are welcoming, that we enable everyone who wants to play sport to play sport,” she said. “Where inclusion bumps up against fairness and safety, it’s down for an individual sport to consider and make the decisions that are most appropriate for that sport.” Munday was speaking at an event to announce a pilot scheme that aims to give athletes and coaches an independent and confidential way of reporting allegations of bullying, discrimination and abuse in UK Olympic and Paralympic sports. Only four sports have signed up to the Sport Integrity scheme, which will be run by Sport Resolutions, an independent sport-specific dispute resolution service. However, UK Sport is hoping more will do so before it launches next month."
People have false sense of security about Covid risks among friends – study,2022-04-07T13:00:03Z,Nicola Davis Science correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7za4,"The presence, or even the thought, of friends and family can lull people into a false sense of security when it comes to Covid, researchers have found. Marketing experts have revealed that those who believe they previously caught Covid from a friend or family member are less likely to think they would catch it again than those who were infected by an acquaintance or stranger. The team from University Carlos III in Madrid, Spain, say their experiments also suggest this so-called “friend shield effect” appears to be stronger among those who are politically conservative rather than liberal. “Limiting interactions to close friends and family members is a common protective measure to reduce Covid-19 transmission risk, but the study findings demonstrate that this practice also unintentionally creates other issues, in that people tend to perceive reduced health risks and engage in potentially hazardous health behaviours,” the authors report. The findings appear to tie in to what is known as the “intimacy paradox” – the idea that those we feel closest and safest among may in fact pose the biggest risk. The issue has previously been raised by experts in relation to gatherings of friends and family over Christmas and other occasions during the Covid pandemic, with concerns that people tend to drop their guard among those close to them, raising the risk of infections spreading. The researchers, Prof Eline De Vries and Dr Hyunjung Crystal Lee, carried out a series of online experiments involving participants in the US carried out a series of online experiments involving participants in the US. In one task, the team split 495 participants into two groups and asked them to write down a few thoughts about either a friend or an acquaintance. They were then asked to read a paragraph suggesting junk food increased the risk of severe Covid, unlike sanitisers and masks, before being offered a special offer in an online shop for either chocolate bars and crisps or face masks, disinfecting wipes and hand sanitiser. The results, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, reveal 27% of those who made a purchase after writing about a friend chose the junk food, compared with 21% who wrote about an acquaintance. In another task involving 262 people who had not had Covid before, the team found people who were asked to imagine catching the disease from a friend planned to spend an average of $9.28 on items such as masks or hand sanitiser over the next two months – about half of that planned by those who imagined being infected by an acquaintance or stranger. Prof Stephen Reicher, of the University of St Andrews, a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science – who was not involved in new work – said the study added weight to a long line of research that had reached similar conclusions. But he said that despite experts raising the issue, ministers in the UK had repeatedly endorsed the idea that those familiar to us are less of a risk. For example, the minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said Conservative MPs did not need to wear masks during debates in the Commons because they knew each other and had a “convivial, fraternal spirit”. Reicher said studies had also found that people not only trust friends more, but trust members of the same group, such as supporters of the same football team, more even when they are strangers. “There is no moral judgment associated with being infected. Anyone can have Covid, whether friend or foe, acquaintance or stranger,” Reicher said. “And, paradoxically, the more we assume that ‘people like us’ won’t have the virus, the more likely we are to get it from them.”"
‘It’s like putting your soul on a dinner plate’: can anyone sing if they try?,2022-04-07T12:58:36Z,Flora Willson,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ftf,"‘So do you sing?” Scottish star tenor Nicky Spence asks, smiling encouragingly. We’re talking in the marble bowels of a Mayfair hotel after a preview screening of Sky Arts’ new four-part series Anyone Can Sing – and this isn’t how the conversation was supposed to go. I find myself confessing my embarrassment about being an opera historian and music critic who, no, does not sing. And about the time I sang a folk song in a school music competition, crossing the fine line between the just-tolerated nerdery of a teenage violinist and instant social death. “I love you for that!”, he squeals, as I recoil from the horror dredged up from over 20 years ago. That single solo outing aside, I enjoyed singing in choirs as a child. But these days I’m long out of the habit and will do anything to avoid having to sing on my own in front of others. I’m far from alone, of course, which is where Sky Arts’ series comes in. Created in partnership with English National Opera, Anyone Can Sing is TV with a mission. Three vocal coaches – Spence, mezzo-soprano Sarah Pring and countertenor Michael Harper – have three months to provide a “musical SAS” for six participants drawn from what the show’s narrator cheerfully calls “the nation’s vocally challenged”. The hope is to demonstrate that, as the title proclaims, anyone can sing. You’d be forgiven for remaining sceptical in the first episode. There’s a painful compilation of some of the show’s 600+ applicants offering up their best “La”, the results more Florence Foster Jenkins than Frank Sinatra. Beverley, a publican from North Wales, auditions with a few seconds of Stand by Your Man. “At points it looked like you were having a procedure done”, Spence ventures. “Well it’s the first time I’ve sung it sober”, retorts Beverley. Pring gently asks Chris – long hair, big beard, loud shirt – why he thinks he can’t sing. “I’ve listened to myself”, he says with a shrug. And Ellen, a priest and the first female dean of King’s College London, admits she hasn’t sung in front of anyone for 30 years. Her verdict after lesson one with Spence? “They say anyone can sing … I’m not yet convinced.” But what is it about singing that can reduce us so swiftly to shame and silence? Singing, Spence reckons, gets to “the essence of somebody. It’s like putting your soul on a dinner plate in front of you. You have to let go of all bodily functions to be able to sing well.” That takes confidence, clearly – and physical as well as emotional strength. After 25-year-old Luke suffered a brain injury four years ago he has had Tourette’s. “I feel like every time I meet someone new, the tics are the only thing they see”, he explains. Harper has him flapping his arms like wings to release tension. By the end of episode two, we hear a beautiful tenor voice starting to take flight. Sixtysomething Shirley used to joke she was “probably the only black person who can’t dance and can’t sing” and relies heavily on a stick. Pring exhorts her to stand tall and the impact on her voice is extraordinary. “Listen to that power!” Pring roars. “It’s fantastic!” At the end of her first lesson, Shirley walks out unaided, with both women in tears. “I’m not going to become an old lady”, she vows. “I’m going to be diva Shirley!” Ellen, meanwhile, was told as a child that she couldn’t sing (“Shame on anybody that says their kids can’t sing”, Spence thunders when we chat) and has struggled with pitching ever since. The undeniably discordant results will be familiar to anyone who’s ever been labelled tone-deaf – not to mention their loved ones. Although none of the participants could be described as a good singer at the show’s outset, Ellen most audibly challenges its headline premise. Her bravery in allowing TV cameras to capture her warts-and-all attempts is staggering and the effectiveness of Spence’s interventions is a genuine revelation. Watching her dance around her chapel with him while singing more-or-less in tune is a surreal highlight. Most of us can’t hope to be coached into vocal confidence by famous singers. But it’s the personalities that make this such heartwarming telly. Pring emerges as a sort of vocal fairy godmother, Harper as the honeyed voice of zen and Spence as a phenomenally big-hearted teacher, with a one-liner for every occasion. They’re worlds away from both the catty scoring systems of conventional talent shows and the draconian 19th-century singing manuals that decreed aspiring singers must avoid “bicycling, rowing, dancing, long walks, reading late at night, singing too soon after meals and exposure to excessive heat or cold”. Not that this show’s participants would stand for such nonsense. From Shirley’s visible shock as soprano Natalya Romaniw hits one of Puccini’s high notes to Chris’s response to the news that their final challenge will be singing to an audience of 2,500 at the London Coliseum (“There’s a level of panic right now … but it’s going to be fine”) – their down-to-earth warmth is irresistible. Back in the hotel basement Spence admits, “We had no thought that we would find the next Maria Callas or Pavarotti. This is basically unpacking opera and putting the process in a microwave to show them what is possible with this amount of time in terms of making a difference in their lives.” Even halfway through the series, that broad impact is remarkable. We don’t yet know how they’ll fare on the massive stage of the Coliseum, but Sky Arts director Philip Edgar-Jones has apparently enjoyed the show so much he has started singing lessons. Perhaps it’s time for me to do the same. • Anyone Can Sing is airing weekly on Sky Arts, Freeview and Now and is available on demand."
Meta plans ‘Zuck bucks’ virtual coins for Facebook and Instagram users,2022-04-07T12:45:11Z,Mark Sweney,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z84,"Mark Zuckerberg is looking to develop virtual coins, nicknamed “Zuck bucks” by staff, for users of Facebook and Instagram as part of a suite of products designed to reduce his platforms’ dependence on advertising in the future metaverse. Facebook’s parent group, Meta, is looking to develop a range of virtual products – including digital tokens and “creator coins” – to diversify income and revitalise its user base, which is increasingly turning to newer rivals such as TikTok. While Meta remains the dominant social media network provider – its revenues rose 37% to $118bn in 2021 as advertisers clamoured to reach the 4.9 billion monthly active users of Facebook and Instagram – TikTok has also built up a massive non-ads business based on in-app purchases and e-commerce. Meta, which has proven quick to ape successful products rolled out by rivals such as Snapchat, is now exploring ways to further monetise its user base, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the story. Products being looked at include “social tokens” or “reputation tokens”, which could be used as rewards by users. It is also looking at “creator coins”, which could be used by influencers on Instagram. Like Amazon’s Twitch, TikTok uses a tipping system whereby fans can buy its coins to then buy gifts to give to their favourite creators. Creators can also buy coins to use tools such as Promote to boost a TikTok video’s profile, increasing viewers or followers. The initiatives, led by Facebook’s financial arm, Meta Financial Technologies, follow the company’s ill-fated foray into attempting to create a global cryptocurrency, a project called Libra and later Diem, which was abandoned earlier this year after issues with US regulators. That was not the first time Facebook had looked to move into the world of virtual finance. In 2009 it launched Facebook Credits to facilitate in-app purchases in then highly popular games such as Zynga’s FarmVille. While successful, it was shut four years later after Facebook’s international growth made for costly foreign currency conversions. Meta is also looking to enter the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with plans to allow their integration into Instagram and Facebook."
California woman wins $10m after accidentally buying wrong lottery ticket,2022-04-07T12:37:54Z,Guardian staff,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zkf,"A woman accidentally bought the wrong lottery ticket after an unknown stranger bumped into her as she made a purchase from an automatic machine – only to discover she had hit the jackpot and scooped a whopping $10m prize. California TV station KABC reported that LaQuedra Edwards was at a Vons supermarket in the city of Tarzana when she put $40 into a vending machine. She described how “some rude person” bumped into her as she was selecting her options and she ended up mistakenly purchasing a $30 ticket. “He just bumped into me, didn’t say a thing and just walked out the door,” Edwards said in a statement released by the California Lottery. She then returned to her car, scratched off the ticket and discovered she had won a gigantic sum of money. “I didn’t really believe it at first, but I got on the 405 Freeway and kept looking down at [the ticket] and I almost crashed my car,” Edwards said. According to the statement, Edwards plans on buying a house and setting up a charity organization."
"Daddy: A Melodrama review – Black art, white money and love in Speedos",2022-04-07T12:25:19Z,Arifa Akbar,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z4q,"Ever since Sunset Boulevard’s dead protagonist floated into view in the iconic opening sequence of Billy Wilder’s 1950 film, a drama set in a Los Angeles suburb with a swimming pool as its central feature has carried ominous connotations. Daddy’s heated pool is set within a contemporary Bel Air mansion, and is modelled on David Hockney’s swimming pool paintings of the 1960s and 70s. It colonises most of the stage. But the play’s protagonist is very much alive, erupting out of the water in Speedos in the opening scene. This is a sign to expect the unexpected in this bold, brawny, flamboyantly theatrical production written by Jeremy O Harris and first staged off Broadway in 2019. It features an unequal relationship between Franklin (Terique Jarrett), a young Black American artist, and Andre (Claes Bang) an older, white, billionaire art collector who becomes his lover, and whose nickname, “Daddy”, is taken from a moment of sexual role play. Their alliance is queasy from the start, with flecks of Death in Venice but with race, money and art patronage added to the mix; the question of who is exploiting whom hangs indeterminately between them. Throw in Franklin’s churchgoing, gospel-singing moralist mother (Sharlene Whyte) and a mischievous choir (Rebecca Bernice Amissah, Keisha Atwell, T’Shan Williams, all three fabulous) that pops up to heighten the mood and we get the melodrama of the play’s subtitle. The mood is impish and knowing with cool disco beats, sudden spotlights, and a hammy rendition of George Michael’s Father Figure. But for all the theatrics, there is enough sophistication in the writing and in Danya Taymor’s direction for these elements to work to thrilling effect. The short first half brings sharp art world satire through Franklin’s gallerist (Jenny Rainsford), who is at pains to market him to wealthy white clients in exactly the right way. Franklin’s friends, meanwhile, always featured poolside, bring teen-movie satire: Bellamy (Ioanna Kimbrook) is an Insta addict in skimpy swimwear while Max (John McCrea) is a snarky geek who together make an entertainingly vapid double act. There are deadly serious issues at play: Andre regards his lover as he might an objet d’art, to be gazed at and admired. There is not only exoticisation (“chocolate” skin is mentioned) but ownership, too (“You are mine”), and Franklin’s body is always on show, barely clad for the duration of the play. Andre’s white gaze extends to Franklin’s art work; Jean-Michel Basquiat is mentioned at the start, as well as the question of how the value of artwork changes when it is brought into a gallery. Franklin first creates miniature black dolls and then lifesize figures, all of which are sold to rich white celebrity types, as his mother observes. Complicated questions arise out of his art-making: how is blackness packaged and sold in America’s contemporary art market? How does this art world view work made by a queer black artist? And is Franklin colluding in this process for his own gain? A sensational first half hooks us into every last intrigue and all the actors work wonders: Bang, as Andre, has a raffish, Rupert Everett look and gives off a buzzing sense of predation. Jarrett is exquisite as Franklin, balancing innocence with knowing and trauma with playfulness. Whyte’s mother is a baroque creation, both funny and alarming – a preacher in disguise, belting out her moral warnings against her son’s sinful living in song. She turns darker in the second half, and every other character feels skewed so that the drama becomes more feverish and surreal. This longer second part is less masterful than the first. The story seems to dismantle itself but to throw out too many things at once, without following them through deeply. Oedipal strains are felt and buried trauma unearthed in Franklin’s memories of his real, abandoning “daddy”. The play moves into the territory of psychodrama and becomes opaque, locking us out with unexpected turns rather than carry us with it, as the first half has done. But in spite of these frustrations, Daddy never ceases to be interesting. And if there was ever a play wholly worth watching for its perfectly formed first half, this is it. Daddy is at the Almeida theatre, London, until 30 April."
Elmer and Mr Benn author David McKee dies at 87,2022-04-07T12:10:05Z,Lucy Knight,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zaz,"David McKee, the author and illustrator of the iconic children’s books Elmer, Not Now, Bernard and Mr Benn, has died aged 87, his publisher has said. The author and illustrator died surrounded by family in the south of France following a short illness. After a lifetime of travelling the world, he and his partner Bakhta, a French-Algerian art dealer, had been dividing their time between London and Provence in recent years. His long time publisher Klaus Flugge said he was devastated by the news. “His was a singular voice and a shining light in children’s books that highlighted inclusivity, diversity and parts of our world that are not always present in publishing for children.” He added: “Not only was I fortunate to be his publisher, he was also a wonderful friend, and he will be missed by many more people than he could ever imagine.” McKee was born in Tavistock, Devon, and studied at Plymouth Art College. His first book Two Can Toucan was published in 1964 by Flugge when he worked at Abelard-Schuman. When Flugge founded Andersen Press in 1976, McKee moved with him and went on to create more than 50 books for the publisher. McKee wrote and illustrated 29 original stories about the beloved multi-coloured patchwork elephant Elmer, the first of which was published in 1968. The books remain one of the most widely read children’s book series of all time: more than 10m copies have been sold, and they have been translated into more than 60 languages. The themes of inclusivity, celebration and friendship that run through the Elmer stories led the Guardian to hail Elmer as an LGBT hero in 2014. “I never intended to do that,” McKee said in an interview at the time, “but I suspect there are subconscious processes at work I only discover later.” As well as writing and illustrating children’s books, McKee had a successful career as a fine artist, and as a co-creator of animated TV programmes including Mr Benn, based on his series of books about an explorer’s magical adventures. The series celebrated its 50th anniversary last year. McKee was named the BookTrust Lifetime Achievement award winner in 2020. “David McKee understands the importance of always paying attention to children and what he gives them is first-rate,” said chair of judges Nicolette Jones when announcing his win. Speaking to the Guardian in 2020, McKee said: “I’ve often said I think the air is full of stories – you just have to have the right receiver and you pick them up.”"
Mail-order abortion pills become next US reproductive rights battleground,2022-04-07T12:00:02Z,Adrienne Matei,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7j93,"On Tuesday, Oklahoma became the latest state to pass a bill to make performing an abortion a felony, punishable, in this case, by 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine. The bill is expected to be signed into law by the governor, creating an even larger group of people – about 7.7 million between Texas and Oklahoma – who will have to leave their home state if they want an abortion. Republican legislators are passing restrictions and bans on abortion, in expectation of a supreme court decision in a crucial abortion rights case expected in June. Until then, abortion remains legal, albeit severely restricted in some cases, across the US. There was some hope that medication abortions might help alleviate this pressure. In July 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that anyone seeking a medication abortion – that is, an abortion by taking pills, up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, without the need for an operation – would no longer have to pick up the medication in person, or take it in a doctor’s presence. Its decision to stop enforcing in-person requirements for the abortion drug mifepristone was a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, but in December, in consensus with the medical community, it ended the requirement for good. Mifepristone, which data shows is safer than acetaminophen, is now available for US patients to acquire via telehealth services like Abortion on Demand and Just The Pill, which offer online appointments and discreet mail order medications. Consultations and ordering are straightforward and user-friendly on these sites and pills are posted in less than five days. People may take it without a provider’s oversight in the comfort and privacy of their own homes, just as they did after obtaining it in-person from a doctor. The FDA’s decision empowered a wave of certified virtual clinics. In the coming months, the FDA is expected to clarify how pharmacies, like Walgreens and CVS, can distribute mifepristone for the first time. The increased accessibility of abortion medication is a huge asset to people living in states that permit it – in fact, medication abortion accounted for 54% of all US abortions in 2020, up from 39% in 2017, according to research from the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute. “We were overjoyed [at the FDA’s decision], because over the years we’ve been building evidence that continues to show that people who want to use [mifepristone] to end their pregnancy … they are very capable of being able to read the instructions and do so on their own,” says Liza Fuentes, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute. However, 19 states currently have laws requiring an in-person element to abortions, such as an ultrasound or an in-person counseling session, precluding a totally virtual experience. And some states, including Texas, Arizona, and Louisiana ban abortion telehealth services outright. For those seeking an abortion in states where it is restricted, acquiring abortion pills through the mail is a much quicker and more affordable option than having to travel across state lines for an in-person appointment. Already, says Rachel Rebouché, interim dean of Temple University’s law school, people seeking medication abortions can use social media to find advice on how to change their VPNs, have pills illicitly mailed to a FedEx drop-off point in a neighboring state, or how to have pills sent to someone else who can deliver them. But Republicans are aggressively restricting access to telehealth care for abortions in red states, with many creating trigger laws aimed at banning or severely restricting abortion across the board should Roe v Wade be overturned. And while some states have interstate agreements allowing healthcare providers to offer telehealth services across borders, providers are beholden to the laws of the patient’s home state, preventing blue state doctors from mailing abortion medication to red state patients. Republicans are also attempting to amend anti-abortion bills further to prevent red state residents from getting abortions regardless of where the abortion takes place – even if they travel to a blue state to access in-person or telehealth care. Even if, for instance, a resident of an anti-abortion state traveled to California, these laws would see that their body remained under the jurisdiction of their home state. Some red states could likely already prosecute under existing accomplice and conspiracy laws. “You see states like Missouri trying to attach its laws to providers who are providing abortions outside of Missouri, but trying to think about how to civilly penalize those providers by saying ‘any provider who provides an abortion to a Missouri resident is bound by the laws of Missouri,’” says Rebouché. Experts anticipate the brunt of aggressive anti-abortion enforcement will be disproportionately borne by those with few resources – people of color, low-income families, and the young. Blue states are working to enshrine abortion rights within and beyond their borders, with some refusing to accept that state legislatures can impinge on the sovereignty of other states by enforcing laws beyond their own jurisdictions. California and Connecticut are both actively advancing abortion rights, working to shield “providers from legal liability and prevent them from being extradited” and by creating networks for travel for abortion and centers for abortion care, says Rebouché. “The inevitable reality is that even though there is legal liability at stake, mailing abortion medication and administering those pills at home can be really hard to detect,” she adds. “Some states will try to enforce [abortion bans] but others will not because it won’t be worth the cost and it’s going to be difficult to do.”"
Grand National 2022: horse-by-horse guide to all the runners,2022-04-07T12:00:02Z,Greg Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7k6h,"1 Minella Times (age nine, weight 11st 10lb) Carried his rider into the history books 12 months ago as a flawless, ground-saving ride by Rachael Blackmore kept him out of trouble and in the right place to strike for home two out. A similar no-nonsense performance in the saddle can be expected but he is 15lb higher in the ratings and it is nearly half a century since Red Rum became the last top weight to win. Repeat wins in the National are extremely rare for a reason – all the stars need to align just to win once –, never mind with more lead in the saddle. A gallant run into fifth or sixth is probably a more plausible outcome. 2 Delta Work 9yo, 11st 9lb The party-pooper at last month’s Cheltenham Festival, when loud boos rang out from the grandstands after he denied the legendary Tiger Roll victory on his final start. He would be a very popular winner at Aintree, though. The adaptability required to win on his first start over the cross-country obstacles felt like the final piece of the puzzle before his Grand National debut, and he has been attracting plenty of support ever since. With five Grade One chase wins, he also has the class to go with his stamina, but this latest challenge comes 24 days after his huge effort at Cheltenham. With the juice squeezed out of his price, a couple of the fresher horses are marginally preferred. 3 Easysland 8yo, 11st 8lb It looked like a long-term plan was afoot when this cross-country race specialist – an easy winner at Cheltenham in March 2020 – joined Jonjo O’Neill from David Cottin’s French stable at the end of last season. If plot there was, however, three Ps on his record indicating he has been pulled-up three times since suggest it has gone somewhat awry. He showed a little more of his old sparkle before dropping away tamely behind Delta Work in the Cross Country Chase last month, but he is still weighted up to his best and he has a huge amount to find on this season’s form to get anywhere near the frame. 4 Any Second Now 10yo, 11st 8lb Every Grand National has a hard luck story or three, but few match this one’s tale of woe 12 months ago. Ted Walsh’s runner was travelling sweetly, not far off the lead, when he was stopped in his tracks by a faller at the 12th, losing at least a dozen lengths. Mark Walsh worked his way back into contention two out and was still disputing second at the Elbow, a remarkable effort in the circumstances. He is 7lb higher in the ratings this year, which is more than fair on his 2021 form, and has been freshened up since winning a Grade Three in February. With a bit more luck, he will be very tough to keep out of the frame. 5 Run Wild Fred 8yo, 11st 7lb There are faint echoes of Rule The World, the 2016 Grand National winner, about this Gordon Elliott-trained eight-year-old, a second-season novice with high-class form over fences but only one chase win. Rule The World had not even managed that when he came home in front six years ago, and Run Wild Fred made it plain that stamina will not be an issue when he finished second in the National Hunt Chase at Cheltenham last time. He did not look like a horse with an abundance of gears, however, and it will be a surprise if a few nippier types do not have the beating of him. 6 Lostintranslation 10yo, 11st 6lb Looked likely to be a force in the very best races for years to come when he landed the Grade One Betfair Chase in November 2019, but has one win in 10 starts since. On the plus side, one of those defeats was a close third in the 2020 Gold Cup, and he ran well under a big weight at Cheltenham last month, finishing eighth in the Ultima Handicap Chase. That still gives him something to find under another hefty burden here, however, and the top 10 is probably as good as it is likely to get. 7 Brahma Bull 11yo, 11st 6lb Some National runners tick all the right boxes. This one ticks several of the wrong ones, in particular a habit of throwing in a sloppy jump or three in most races. It surfaced again in the Cross Country Chase last month – which looks like one of the key pieces of form for this year’s race – as he unseated his jockey. The Aintree fences are not quite what they were, but clouting one or more can still be enough to cost you any chance of a win and this one is likely to be back among the also-rans. 8 Burrows Saint 9yo, 11st 5lb Going as well as the winner three from home last year but failed to see it out, finishing 27 lengths behind Minella Times. His finishing effort was also disappointing in the Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse in February, form which gives him little chance of beating either Any Second Now or Escaria Ten. While Willie Mullins sees him as his No 1 contender, that probably says more about the relative weakness of his team this year. 9 Mount Ida 8yo, 11st 5lb Another member of Elliott’s eight-strong stable , but one of the least convincing candidates to give her trainer a record-equalling fourth success. Stamina is unlikely to be an issue – she has looked to be crying out for a test like this for much of her career – but her jumping is generally so-so at best and comes with a tendency to veer sharply right. On a left-handed track like Aintree, that could cost her many lengths, and her latest run in the new Mares’ Chase at Cheltenham was a let down. Easily overlooked. 10 Longhouse Poet 8yo, 11st 4lb Martin Brassil hit the bullseye with Numbersixvalverde, his first Grand National runner, in 2006, saddled the same horse to finish sixth a year later and then sent Double Seven to finish third in 2014. This is his first National runner since and won the ultra-competitive Thyestes Chase – a race that Numbersixvalverde landed the season before his Aintree win – in January, with several of today’s opponents well beaten. As an eight-year-old making just his seventh chase start, he has more scope for improvement than most and at around 16-1 is an excellent bet to further improve Brassil’s excellent record in the world’s most famous steeplechase. 11 Fiddlerontheroof 8yo 11st 4lb A live candidate to be the best of the British-trained runners, but even that would be no guarantee of an each-way return given the strength of the Irish challenge. The eight-year-old’s domestic form is rock-solid, however, and Colin Tizzard also resisted the urge to run him at Cheltenham, despite an excellent run in the Ladbrokes Trophy in November that could have persuaded him to aim at the Gold Cup. A sound jumper who goes on any ground, though his stamina is untested at a marathon trip and more dependable stayers can be backed at much the same price. 12 Two For Gold 9yo, 11st 3lb Beaten less than two lengths in a Grade One race at Ascot last time, which is strong form for a horse getting weight from several of the major fancies. That was over two miles and five furlongs, however, and in addition to the question mark over his stamina, the fact he fell on his first attempt over these fences – in the Topham Trophy last season – is another concern. Kim Bailey, his trainer, knows what it takes to win this, having saddled Mr Frisk in 1990, but a price of around 40-1 looks fair. 13 Santini 10yo, 11st 2lb A top-class chaser at his best, who went down by a neck in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March 2020. If he has been on the downslope of his career since, it has been a fairly gentle one. A change of scenery may have helped, having switched from Nicky Henderson to Polly Gundry over the summer, and he was up with the leaders for much of the way in last month’s renewal. One of several who could show up well for a long way if the fences fire him up, while unlikely to maintain his challenge beyond the second-last. 14 Samcro 10yo 11lb 1lb Lauded as a potential all-time great when he ran up a sequence of wins as a novice hurdler in 2017/18, though Michael O’Leary, his owner, said at the time “he will never be as good as the hype will make out”. The 10-year-old has had his moments, including three Grade One wins and as Elliott points out, it “would be a Samcro thing to do” to “run a massive race”, but it would be a Samcro thing to finish 16th – as he did on his first start in a handicap chase – and that is the more credible scenario. 15 Escaria Ten 8yo 11st 1lb Closely matched with Any Second Now on their form in the Bobbyjo Chase in February, when last year’s third gave 8lb to Elliott’s eight-year-old – 1lb more than he will on Saturday – and edged him by a nose. The time of that race was notably strong too, and a real step forward from Escaria Ten’s comeback run behind Longhouse Poet in the Thyestes Chase. He was probably feeling the effects of a big effort at Cheltenham when pulled up in last year’s Irish National and definitely makes the short list. 16 Good Boy Bobby 9yo, 10st 13lb Owners Isaac Souede and Simon Munir have four runners and their No 1 rider, Daryl Jacob, has opted to ride this one, though he remains a 33-1 outsider to give them a first National success. Won in the Rowland Meyrick Chase at Christmas, while a change of tactics from his usual front-running may be to blame for a lesser run last time. Unproven beyond three miles, has a fair bit to find with the market leaders and no obvious reason why he should bridge the gap going up in trip. 17 Lord Du Mesnil 9yo, 10st 13lb A decent winner of the Grand National Trial at Haydock – on the heavy ground he loves – in February 2021, but his form figures since look more like a bad Scrabble hand, with three Ps and a U. Never sighted in last year’s race, on much faster ground, and conditions are against him again this time. Would be a cheeky each-way stab if the heavens opened on Friday, but otherwise easily ruled out. 18 Coko Beach 7yo, 10st 13lb There are several heavyweight contenders in Elliott’s National squad, but Coko Beach fits more snugly into the bantamweight division. Seven-year-olds simply don’t win the National these days and while a win in last season’s Thyestes Chase is a plus, he was well beaten off a higher mark in the same race this season. Appeared to be running on fumes in a three-and-a-half mile race at Punchestown in February – and the National is another six furlongs. 19 De Rasher Counter 10yo, 10st 12lb Emma Lavelle’s 10-year-old gets the nod for Best Outsider at around 40-1. His win in the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury in 2019 is one of the best individual pieces of form on offer in this year’s field. He will race off the same handicap mark and arrives on the back of an eye-catching run in February’s Denman Chase – his first start for 489 days after a tendon injury. Lavelle’s stable is a match for any when it comes to getting a top-notch horse big-race ready and it would be no surprise to see him outrun his odds. 20 Kildisart 10yo, 10st 11lb One of the better staying novice chasers in 2018/19, when he also won a handicap on the National undercard, but was off the track for 462 days before returning to action at Newbury in March. Has always looked likely to improve over a marathon trip but this is a swift return to action after a long break and he was among the potential rides that Daryl Jacob turned down. James Bowen gets the call-up, but his third National ride looks no more likely to prevail than the first two. 21 Discorama 9yo, 10st 11lb Showed up well for a long way as a 16-1 shot last year and briefly threatened to do even better than his eventual finish in seventh when he moved towards the lead with four to jump. In the end, though, his finishing effort was tame, and even the veteran Blaklion managed to breeze past him on the run-in. His light schedule this year has clearly been designed with a return to Aintree in mind and co-owner Andrew Gemmell, of Paisley Park fame, has a happy knack of getting involved with fairytale success stories, but 40-1 does not feel unduly generous. 22 Top Ville Ben 10yo, 10st 11lb Philip Kirby’s gelding should at least get a mention or two from the commentator as a confirmed frontrunner, but shout-outs at the business end will be more a lot more difficult to achieve. His first experience over these fences ended with a heavy fall at the 12th fence in the Becher Chase in December and even if that experience has not left a mark, his exuberant running style is likely to see his elastic band fully unwound with a few fences still to jump. 23 Enjoy D’Allen 8yo, 10st 11lb Few trainers have as much to gain on Saturday as Ciaran Murphy, whose small stable would jump through several leagues if Enjoy D’Allen comes home in front. Murphy has been on the staff at Charlestown Stud for 25 years, but took over the licence 15 months ago and has already seen his eight-year-old run third in last season’s Irish National. That form gives him a big chance on Saturday, so much so that JP McManus was persuaded to buy a share after a solid prep run. “I’ve been thinking about nothing else all year,” he said recently. “Winning would be off the Richter scale.” Murphy’s gelding is a fair 14-1 shot to record a groundbreaking success. 24 Anibale Fly 12yo, 10st 11lb A top-class chaser in his day, who finished second in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2019 and fifth – under top weight – behind Tiger Roll in the National a few weeks later. He also finished fourth on his first startin 2018, but was never going well when attempting to make it third time lucky last season. He has shown no more than occasional glimpses of worthwhile form since and while handicap runners from the Tony Martin yard have a reputation for dramatic improvement when the big day arrives, little short of a miracle is requiredfor him to make a mark this time. 25 Dingo Dollar 10yo, 10st 11lb A change of surroundings made a world of difference to Sandy Thompson’s gelding, who seemed to have peaked as long ago as November 2018, when he was third in the Ladbrokes Trophy for Alan King, but has found a new lease of life in Scotland. Runner-up in the Scottish National last April, but yet to recapture that kind of form this year and he did not seem impressed by the Aintree experience in the 2020 Becher Chase. A worthy 66-1 shot. 26 Freewheelin Dylan 10yo, 10st 10lb Already a history-maker having won the Irish National at 150-1 last year. Run Wild Fred and Enjoy D’Allen, who are at a much shorter price, finished second and third that day so a return to that level would – theoretically, at least – make him a player, but subsequent form suggests it was a flash-in-the-pan moment. Sheila Mangan, his owner, backed him at 50-1, 66-1 and then 150-1 – “ah, for feck sake, I have to have a bit of that as well” as she put it – and will presumably do so again now, but only optimists will follow her in. 27 Class Conti 10yo, 10st 10lb Finished 129 lengths behind Minella Times 12 months ago, when he arrived at Aintree in something approaching fair form, having made the frame in the Thyestes Chase earlier in the campaign. Has not come anywhere close to that level this year and Sam Twiston-Davies’s mount is rightly bracketed with the no-hopers at around 150-1. 28 Noble Yeats 7yo, 10st 10lb Snapped up by Robert Waley-Cohen in February as a National mount for his son, the leading amateur rider Sam. The Waley-Cohen colours have been carried to victory six times over the Grand National fences, but never, as yet, in the National. While Noble Yeats has bits of form to suggest he could be an Aintree horse one day, his debut is probably coming at least a year too soon. 29 Mighty Thunder 9yo, 10st 10lb Lucinda Russell was the last British trainer to win the National, with One For Arthur five years ago, and her runner this year put down an excellent marker with a doughty success in the 2021 Scottish National, when making his sixth start over fences. He has failed to build on that and was reported to have suffered a breathing problem in the Edinburgh National in February. Better the further he goes, so the Aintree trip will hold no fears, but an immense leap of faith is required to back him on this year’s form. 30 Cloth Cap 10yo, 10st 10lb Set off as the much-fancied 11-2 favourite last year and was still chasing the leader five from home, but faded rapidly and was pulled up. A breathing problem was diagnosed and he had an operation to address it before returning to action this season, but the old Cloth Cap has yet to reappear. He looked like the best-handicapped horse in the field 12 months ago and is rated 1lb lower now at 25-1, but he found very little at the end of the Grimthorpe Chase at Doncaster last time. 31 Snow Leopardess 10yo, 10st 9lb Charlie Longsdon’s mare has plenty of the attributes you look for in a winner, up to and including Hollywood blockbuster potential – she would be the first mum to win the race. Snow Leopardess gave birth to a filly foal during an 18-month absence from the track, but that is just one strand of a remarkable storyline involving her breeder, 80-year-old Marietta Fox-Pitt. “I wasn’t any different after I had children,” Fox-Pitt says when asked why she sent Snow Leopardess back into training, “so why should she be?” Recuperated with Marietta’s son, the event rider William Fox-Pitt and his wife, Alice Plunkett, part of the ITV Racing team, so her post-race interview has the potential to be teary TV gold. Odds of around 9-1 are short enough as she did not have a huge amount to spare at the end of the Becher Chase in December. 32 Agusta Gold 9yo, 10st 9lb Like Snow Leopardess, attempting to become the first mare to win the National since Nickel Coin in 1951. Unlike Snow Leopardess, she has very little chance of doing so and could well be the weakest link even in Mullins’s sub-par squad for this race. 33 Phoenix Way 9yo, 10st 9lb Ran in a Grade One novice event at this meeting last year but that was over two-and-a-half miles and extreme distances remain a big unknown over fences. Also a sketchy jumper at times, taking a crunching fall on his latest start at Kempton Park, so an easy runner to dismiss when there are so many better alternatives on offer. 34 Deise Aba 9yo, 10st 8lb Has scraped in towards the bottom of the list after narrowly missing out in 2021, but seems to show his best form on heavy ground and also at right-handed Sandown Park. Left behind from around a mile out in the Welsh National in December and highly unlikely to fare much better in the even more demanding surroundings of Aintree. 35 Blaklion 13yo, 10st 8lb A former favourite for this race – running well to finish fourth– and Dan Skelton’s gelding has winning form over the National fences too, in the Becher Chase. That was all back in 2017, when Blaklion was a spry eight-year-old. It is 99 years since a teenager won the Grand National and it is more important than ever to have youth on your side these days. Easily overlooked. 36 Poker Party 10yo, 10st 8lb Won the Kerry National two seasons ago but had a year off in 2020/21 and has shown nothing in three starts in the current campaign. Form figures of 00P sum up his chance succinctly. 37 Death Duty 11yo, 10st 7lb Effectively “subbed” into the Elliott squad when the stable scratched Battleoverdoyen this week, creeping in at the foot of the weights. A dual Grade One winner and better the further he goes, so a fair chance of a top-10 finish if he rekindles his best form. 38 Domaine De L’Isle 9yo, 10st 7lb Twenty-two lengths behind Snow Leopardess in the Becher Chase and little to no chance of reversing the form if his disappointing run in the Eider Chase at Newcastle last time is any guide. If you draw him in the sweep, have another go. 39 Eclair Surf 8yo, 10st 6lb The stress of the big race will be water off a duck’s back to connections after a nerve-shredding wait to see if their eight-year-old would get a run. It is a sign of how deeply competitive a modern National is that an easy winner of the Classic Chase at Warwick is struggling to make it in at the bottom of the weights. Now that he is confirmed as a runner, he will set off as one of the favourites. Followed up his Warwick success by running a cracker behind Win My Wings in the Eider and the winner there bolted up in last week’s Scottish National. 40 Fortescue 8yo, 10st 6lb Simply making it into the final field is an achievement for Henry Daly’s gelding, who was 67th on the original list of weights in February. Returned to winning form at Ascot last time but the ground simply can’t be heavy enough for him – it would have needed to start raining on Monday to give him any chance. Reserves: 41 Commodore 10yo, 10st 5lb First reserve. Unraced since an easy win at Cheltenham in December, has been a weak finisher in the past. 42 School Boy Hours 9yo, 10st 5lb Second reserve. Pulled up after a bad mistake four out in the Kim Muir at Cheltenham last time. 43 Romain De Senam 10yo, 10st 5lb Third reserve. Looked a non-stayer when pulled up in the Midlands Grand National at Uttoxeter last time. 44 Roi Mage 10yo, 10st 3lb Fourth reserve. Two races in Ireland since joining Patrick Griffin’s stable, showing no sign of form that gives him any chance here. Greg Wood’s top four 1) Longhouse Poet 2) Any Second Now 3) Enjoy D’Allen 4) Escaria Ten Best outsider De Rasher Counter"
Akshata Murty: Rishi Sunak’s wife and richer than the Queen,2022-04-07T11:27:04Z,Rupert Neate,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zf5,"Just months after Akshata Murty was born in April 1980, she was sent to live with her paternal grandparents after her parents moved hundreds of miles away to Mumbai for work. “Your mother and I were young then and struggling to find our feet in our careers,” her father wrote in a letter to Akshata, which was published in Legacy; Letters from eminent parents to their daughter. “Two months after your birth in Hubli [a city near Goa], we brought you to Mumbai, but discovered quickly enough that it was a difficult task to nurture a child and manage careers side by side. So, we decided that you would spend the initial years of your life with your grandparents in Hubli.” Her father, NR Narayana Murthy, a young computer programmer who would go on to launch the IT services company Infosys and become a billionaire, said leaving Akshata behind was one of the hardest decisions he had had to make. “Every weekend, I would take the plane to Belgaum [a nearby airport] and then hire a car to Hubli. It was very expensive, but I couldn’t do without seeing you.” Her mother, Sudha Murty, a computer scientist and engineer, was the first female engineer to work for India’s then largest carmaker, part of the Tata conglomerate, and is now a philanthropist working to improve public healthcare. When Akshata did join her parents, and later her brother, Rohan, in Mumbai, life might not have been as relaxed as it was with her grandparents in Hubli. Sudha “decided early on that there would be no TV in our home so that there would be time for things like studying, reading, discussions and meeting friends”, according to the book. Every evening, 8pm to 10pm was dedicated to “pursuits that brought the family together in a productive environment”. For Akshata and Rohan, that meant homework, while their parents “read books on history, literature, physics, mathematics and engineering, or did any office work”. As the family became increasingly rich, Akshata’s parents eschewed hiring a private car and driver to take her school, preferring to stick with the “regular autorickshaw” where she made “great friends with the ‘rickshaw uncle’”. Murty went to the private liberal Claremont McKenna College in California, where she studied economics and French, before moving to the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles. She worked for Deloitte and Unilever before studying for an MBA at Stanford University. It was at Stanford that she met Rishi Sunak, who had won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship. Within four years, they were married in a two-day ceremony in Bengaluru, attended by cricketing royalty including the Indian spinner Anil Kumble and the family of Rahul Dravid, the former captain of the national cricket team. Her father said he was a “little sad and jealous” when Akshata first told him of her new life partner. “But when I met Rishi and found him to be all that you had described him to be – brilliant, handsome and, most importantly, honest – I understood why you let your heart be stolen.” After Stanford, she joined a Dutch clean technology incubator fund in San Francisco as marketing director in 2007, but left quickly to start her own fashion label, Akshata Designs. “I understand that there may be some curiosity around what I’m doing given my parents’ achievements, but I hope that one day this business is able to stand on its own feet and I’m able to speak on its merit rather than anything else,” she told the Times of India in 2009 when she founded the business. “This is my passion and I couldn’t imagine being engaged in anything else but the business of this venture.” The business, however, collapsed within three years. Money comes in from her 0.91% stake in Infosys, which is valued at about $900m (£690m), making Murty richer than the Queen (£365m). The couple also own London-based Catamaran Ventures UK, which invests in startups “with the view to future capital growth and income distributions”. Sunak transferred his shares to her just before entering parliament, and she is now the sole owner. She has direct shareholdings in at least six other UK companies, including the gentlemen’s outfitters New &amp; Lingwood, which measures Etonians for their tailcoats and sells silk dressing gowns for £2,500 each. Murty also holds shares in a UK business that operates Jamie Oliver’s Pizzeria, Jamie’s Italian and Wendy’s outlets in India, the nanny agency Koru Kids, and the gym operator Digme Fitness, where she is a director. Both New &amp; Lingwood and Digme furloughed staff during the pandemic. Soroco, a software company cofounded by her brother, lists Murty as a director of its UK arm. Murty and Sunak own at least four homes in the UK and California, including a five-bedroom mews house in Kensington valued at almost £7m, and a £1.5m Georgian mansion set in 12 acres in Sunak’s North Yorkshire constituency, as well as a flat on the Old Brompton Road in west London. They also own a Santa Monica beach penthouse valued at £5.5m, which the property developer describes as having “stunning views of the Santa Monica mountains” and where you “wake up to the sound of waves crashing against the shore”."
‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,2022-04-07T11:47:53Z,Natalie Grover,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y6dhn,"Commuters to London’s Liverpool Street were treated to a taboo-busting billboard last week, featuring a mother of two weightlifting, while leaking actual liquid. The ad is part of the “leaks happen” campaign, from the women’s health brand Elvie, aiming to raise awareness of a common, but largely obscured, problem – postpartum incontinence. Claire Hackett, the Alliance party rep for Mid Ulster in Northern Ireland, can testify first-hand how women are suffering in silence, and says that openness is exactly what’s needed. When she returned to work 10 months after the birth of her third child, the impact of injuries following all three births continued to complicate her life. “I can remember the sweat and the fear of ‘Oh my God, what might happen if I don’t get to the toilet’. It’s things like this that you don’t really want to talk to people about.” Hackett’s difficulties started about 10 years ago, after having her first child, which left her with a third-degree tear – meaning the rupture went as far as the muscle that controls the anus. After surgery, Hackett was handed a leaflet for pelvic floor exercises. Eight months later, she still hadn’t healed, and was experiencing stinging while urinating as well as bladder control problems. “My husband and I hadn’t had sex at that point because I was still so scared of what was going on with my pelvic region,” she says. She was referred to a “back class”, where women got together and did a circuit of back exercises, which helped strengthen her core, but achieved little else. Many women, says Hackett, are too afraid, ashamed or embarrassed to draw attention to their pelvic problems after childbirth. Added to this is the coy acceptance of the problem, “like in Tena ads for your little ‘oops’ moments. Like this is just what happens to women,” she says. “Yes, it’s common to experience incontinence. But it’s not normal: there are things that can be done.” Myra Robson, a clinical lead physiotherapist and co-founder of the pelvic health campaign group Pelvicroar, says part of the problem is that women aren’t adequately prepared for birth trauma. “There’s still a much greater emphasis on this lovely romantic version of childbirth. People aren’t prepared for the fact that there can be a problem when you’re trying to get a whole human being out of this relatively small space,” she says. “I think we’re very unrealistic about that. We need to empower women to vocalise when they’re having problems and do something about it.” It’s certainly not a niche concern: as many as one in three women experience urinary incontinence in the three months after childbirth, according to the National Childbirth Trust (NCT). And it can also develop in the years that follow. According to Julie Cornish, colorectal consultant at the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and vice-president of the MASIC Foundation – a charity that supports women who have been severely injured during childbirth – research shows that one in five women develop problems controlling their bowels in the first five years after giving birth vaginally. Being pregnant and giving birth can also weaken the pelvic floor – the supportive hammock made of muscles and tissues that keeps the pelvic organs (the uterus, bladder and bowel) in place. When the pelvic floor is overstretched – if the baby is large, during an assisted birth (using forceps, for example) or if labour is prolonged – one or more of these organs can descend (prolapse) into the vagina. One writer described the experience as a feeling of constantly sitting on an egg. But women are not necessarily warned of these risks, says Ranee Thakar, vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. “Mothers tell me – when I see them – that nobody ever told them that these [pelvic floor disorders] could happen.” After childbirth there is a lot of focus on the baby – and rightly so, says Thakar. “But we also need to think about the mother, especially given pelvic problems are not always readily apparent after delivery.” Undetected or mild birth trauma can escalate into more serious conditions as women age, she adds. Postnatal care has long been patchy – even before the pandemic – partly due to a lack of education among healthcare professionals as well as the embarrassment and stigma that impedes mothers from reporting their issues in the first place. Covid simply exacerbated these underlying fissures, says Cornish: “We are facing a massive uphill battle, because cancer cases are going to be taking priority and so pelvic floor problems get pushed to the back of the queue again.” For the most part, pregnant women are offered some education by the NHS about what to expect all the way through to delivery, but these classes are not uniform across the country. After birth, women are typically given a leaflet with instructions for exercises they can do to get their pelvic floor muscles back into shape (although pinpointing those muscles can be tricky). Meanwhile, postnatal care is largely the responsibility of community midwives. Around the six- to eight-week mark, a postnatal check on mother and baby is conducted by GPs. If a serious injury emerges, mothers are typically referred to secondary care. Twenty years ago, there were three or four clinics focused on pelvic floor problems across the UK, but while there are many more now, says Thakar, “they’re not there everywhere”. Waiting lists are long and increasing staff shortages haven’t helped. “In terms of a full pelvic floor assessment,” says Robson, “it’s usually the physiotherapists that do it, and there’s just simply not enough of us to go around.” Christine Sweet, who lives in Greater Manchester, gave birth for the first time in June 2021. Her delivery involved an episiotomy (an incision between the vaginal opening and the anus to make more space for the baby), as well as forceps, both well-known risk factors for future pelvic complications. She was discharged from hospital about 24 hours after giving birth and put in the care of a community midwifery team. A few days later, her episiotomy stitches came apart. In pain, Sweet went to her GP, who diagnosed her with an infection, suggesting it was acquired in hospital. The doctor was “horrified at the sight of the wound and didn’t know what to do. She rang gynaecology at the hospital, and they said that until the infection had been cleared, they weren’t prepared to see me.” Sweet says that having an open wound that wasn’t healing was more painful than the labour. “Nobody seemed to know what to do with it, or what should be done to keep the wound clean and who was meant to be reviewing it.” Eventually, after four courses of antibiotics, the infection cleared, but Sweet was told her problem did not satisfy the criteria for urgent referral to gynaecology. The waiting list for a standard appointment was hovering between six months and a year. Twelve weeks after the birth of her son, she managed to find some childcare, and went to A&amp;E. After hours of waiting, it was determined her wound needed to be cauterised – a process in which electricity or chemicals are used to burn tissue in order to close a wound. It was done there and then, and healed soon after, but that wasn’t end of her problems. Finally, more than three months after giving birth, she had a full internal examination with a pelvic health physio team, where it was confirmed that she had developed a prolapse. “It seems that if you have a baby, you should expect to be in pain,” said Sweet. “But the more you try to keep a lid on it … it doesn’t give women the true picture of what can go wrong, and then importantly how you can fix things once they have gone wrong.” Melissa Bubnic, a freelance script writer in London, has been on a waiting list for reparative surgery for more than a year. Bubnic initially realised something was wrong in 2019, three months after giving birth to her second child. Sitting on the bus on her way to an event, she smelled something odd. A visit to the loo confirmed her fears – she had soiled herself. Fortunately, she had wet wipes on hand, but about a month later, it happened again. When she saw her GP that May, she was referred to pelvic specialists at a London hospital. With demand far outstripping supply for such services, it could take up to a year to get an appointment. Finally, in November 2019, she went for an endoanal scan. “I wanted to believe that everything was OK,” says Bubnic, “so I asked if everything was OK back there. She said, ‘No, it’s really not OK.’” “It was the first time anyone had told me that something was really wrong – I had had a fourth-degree tear that had been missed.” It was likely, she was told, that the tear had occurred back in 2015, during the birth of her first child, when she was given an episiotomy and forceps had been used. By May 2020, she still hadn’t been able to see an NHS physiotherapist – and felt as if she was being dissuaded from seeking the opinion of a colorectal surgeon. “I was told that a referral would be made but whenever I called, they couldn’t find the referral in the system. And I had to kind of get a bit cross.” She finally saw a colorectal surgeon in November 2020 and was put on the waiting list for surgery, but the pandemic has increased delays. Tired of waiting, she took a punt on an advertisement posted by a PhD student investigating the impact of serious birth trauma. She was assessed by a medical team at St Mark’s hospital, a specialist bowel hospital in Harrow, London, earlier this year, and underwent surgery there last month. “I have been so incredibly lucky,” she said. Both Bubnic and Hackett have sought out private physiotherapy, too. “I just always thought, you have babies, you wet yourself,” says Hackett. “It’s just what you have to put up with. So, to find out that I could rehab my pelvic floor to the level that I have, and it’s still not even perfect … I couldn’t believe it.” The cost for private physiotherapy can be prohibitive at about £100 for the initial consultation (depending on geography), and slightly lower rates for follow-up appointments. Many campaigners cite France as a country with better pelvic healthcare. Mothers there are automatically prescribed multiple sessions of physio to “re-educate” their pelvic floor after delivery. But there is acknowledgment that postpartum care in the UK is ripe for improvement, and earlier this year NHS England announced the opening of 14 new pelvic health clinics, bringing together midwives, specialist doctors and physiotherapists to improve the prevention, identification and treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction. Physical injuries aside, the sexual and mental health impact of postpartum trauma is devastating, says Bubnic. “You just feel so sexless and dirty. Incontinence is so mortifying. The mental health impact of being scared to leave your house, or having an accident – every women who has these injuries has to deal with that.” When Bubnic first discovered the severity of her injury, she didn’t know anybody else who had faced a similar situation. “I felt so ashamed and embarrassed,” she says. “I need a lot of support around managing the injury and navigating this labyrinthine health system. Even when you want to talk to NHS staff, who are trying to help you, bringing up the sex aspect, everyone looks a bit awkward and doesn’t really know what to say. “I just don’t believe that if the genders were reversed,” she adds, “if it was men, in the act of becoming fathers, who were ripped from testicles to anus and left incontinent – that we wouldn’t be doing something to address that.”"

Project Dictator review – meta clowning lays bare real terror,2022-04-07T11:39:59Z,Miriam Gillinson,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z73,"We begin with a political sketch show that sputteringly descends into farce. Elements of absurdist theatre seep in, then clowning and finally brooding despair. Rhum + Clay’s latest devised work is a Russian doll of a production, which peels back the layers of performance until it hollows out completely. The writers are occasionally a little too entranced by their own ingenuity but there are still plenty of powerful images and ideas here – particularly the growing sense that the time for play and pretence, in such politically fraught times, is over. Co-directors and performers Matt Wells and Julian Spooner, along with co-director Hamish Macdougall, have conceived Project Dictator in collaboration with a group of international artists, all living under oppressive regimes. Their influence isn’t felt in direct quotations (the script is far too meta for that) but is instead threaded into the outer edges of the production. It’s there in the flickers of fear in Wells and Spooner’s eyes as they peek anxiously into the wings; the sinister sway of the music and lighting; the absolute impossibility of stopping the show and beginning again. Long-term collaborators Wells and Spooner bring out the best in each other. Wells is the straight guy: a “polymath theatre maker” determined to make his “state of the nation” political satire. Spooner plays the comedy sidekick, puffing and panting with manic energy and hell bent on creating something fun. But while they’re a great double act, the earlier scenes feel caught somewhere between an Edinburgh sketch show and high-concept satire. They never quite take off. It’s only in the second half, when a diaphanous curtain drops down in front of the stage, that this show finally reveals itself. We’re left to peer at two clowns, frantically preparing backstage. It’s a powerful design from Blythe Brett that hints at a darker underbelly we choose to ignore: the fearful reality that lurks beneath all that political clowning. The music, performed live by Syrian Jazz musician Khaled Kurbeh, suddenly becomes stranger, scarier, ensnaring. We watch the clowns apply their makeup and, as the white powder swiftly covers over their features, disappear almost completely. Project Dictator is at New Diorama theatre, London, until 30 April."
"Going once, going twice … gold! Men’s 100m Olympic medal up for auction",2022-04-07T11:38:23Z,Neil Duncanson,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7tmm,"Harrison Dillard should never have won the 1948 Olympic 100 metres gold medal on a blazing July day at Wembley Stadium. He shouldn’t have been in the final. This weekend, that gold medal is up for sale. He entered the event at the American trials to sharpen his speed work for the high hurdles, his specialist event. Back then, the 25-year-old Clevelander was the greatest sprint hurdler the world had seen and had racked up 82 consecutive wins before the trials and held the world record of 13.6sec in the 120-yard hurdles. He was deemed unbeatable. Then catastrophe struck. “All I had to do was finish third and I was in the team,” he said. “But on that particular day, as history shows, I finished dead last. I hit the first hurdle, got over the second and then hit every other hurdle in succession, stopping completely at the eighth. I had totally lost the rhythm of the race and my timing was so completely destroyed I just stopped and didn’t even finish. “Here I was, the world record-holder and American champion and it all went for naught because under the American system you qualify on that day or you don’t make it at all.” But he had managed to squeak third spot in the 100m, so he was able to join the US team on the boat to London for what became known as the austerity Games, a unifying moment of hope and spectacle for the British public in a city scarred by six years of war and blighted by strict rationing. The skinny Dillard, 143lb soaking wet and known to his teammates as “Bones”, then ran the race of his life to win one of the closest 100m finals in Olympic history. The Omega photo finish camera, used for the first time at the Games, captured the inches that separated Dillard, running on the outside lane, and the US No 1, Barney Ewell, in Lane 2, who was so convinced he had won the race he bounded almost halfway around the track before realising the result had not gone his way. On a cinder track, in front of 83,000 spectators, Dillard had posted a time of 10.3sec, with Ewell second in 10.4sec and Panama’s Lloyd LaBeach third. Scot Alistair McCorquodale was fourth, with the 100 yards world record-holder, Mel Patton, plagued once again by big competition nerves, fifth, and Britain’s highly fancied McDonald Bailey last. “To see the flag, the Stars &amp; Stripes, as it goes up the flagpole while the national anthem is playing, with the medal around your neck, that’s when I think it really hits you,” he said. “I remember the hair standing up on the back of my neck as I stood to attention in that proud and particular moment. I don’t think I teared up, but I felt terrific emotion.” Nearly 75 years on, his medal, along with other Olympic medals, is in the Ingrid O’Neil Olympic auction, in California. The estimate is somewhere north of $120,000 (£92,000). Olympic gold medals at auction are as rare as hen’s teeth and this is reckoned to be the first men’s 100m gold to come up for public sale. The big hope is one of the grander museums, either the Olympic Museum in Lausanne or the History Center in Cleveland, will acquire it and display it to the public. But the pandemic has played merry hell with museum budgets, so no one is sure where it will go or what price it will fetch. What would Dillard have made of it all? He would certainly have taken it all with a customary big smile and in that very large stride of his. He was a charming, humble and articulate man who won the hearts of everyone he met. He served in the second world war as one of the Buffalo Soldiers, a segregated black division who fought their way through Italy in some of the toughest battles of the conflict. He hardly mentioned it. Or the fact that none other than General George S Patton said, after watching Dillard win four events in a postwar GI track meet, that he was “the best goddam athlete I’ve ever seen in my life”. But he did love that he had emulated his childhood idol and fellow Cleveland high-schooler Jesse Owens. Dillard marvelled at the modern sprinters, especially Usain Bolt, but well into his 90th year he said: “Jesse and I could have taken him, if we trained real hard.” His daughter Terri decided to sell the 100m medal – the first of four golds Dillard won at the 1948 and 1952 Olympics – but the other three will stay in the family. “It was a tough call to make but I’m hoping it will go to someone who will appreciate and honour it. Hopefully a museum where it can be on display. “My dad never kept the medals on display at home, but he’d always get them out if anyone asked. My mother actually put one of them on a gold chain for him and he’d wear it sometimes.” After the 100m triumph in London, he collected another gold in a controversial sprint relay (the US team won, was disqualified, protested and was reinstated), then went back into training for the Helsinki Games of 1952. He chose not to defend his 100m title, but to set the record straight in the 110m hurdles, running an Olympic record of 13.7sec to take gold and collected another in the relay. He retired from the track after failing to make the US team for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, working first in the back office of the Cleveland Indians baseball club, before forging a long and successful career with the Cleveland Board of Education. He was always a popular visitor to big track meets around the world and returned to London in 2012 to watch Bolt claim his second Olympic sprint title. Cleveland mourned when he died, in November 2019, at the age of 96. • Neil Duncanson is the author of The Fastest Men on Earth – The Inside Stories of the Men’s 100 Metres Champions, with a foreword by Usain Bolt, published by Welbeck"
Compartment No 6 review – meet-uncute train romance is a Finnish Before Sunrise,2021-07-10T15:17:19Z,Peter Bradshaw,https://www.theguardian.com/p/t52x2,"Despite the bone-chilling cold of its location in Murmansk in Russia’s remote north-west, there’s a wonderful human warmth and humour in this offbeat romantic story of strangers on a train. It comes from Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen, whose 2016 film The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki was a lovely comedy about a real-life Finnish boxing champ in the 1960s. His new film is adapted from a novel of the same name by Finnish artist and author Rosa Liksom, and concerns a young Finnish student of archaeology, Laura (Seidi Haarla) who is in Moscow sometime in the early 90s; she has begun an impulsive affair with her professor, Irina (Dirana Drukarova). Under Irina’s tutelage, with her encouragement, and perhaps because this older woman does not care to have Laura hanging around much longer, Laura has resolved to make the tough rail journey up to Murmansk where she wants to view the petroglyphs there - mysterious rock drawings, thousands of years old. Sweet-natured, open-hearted Laura gets on this uncomfortable train in the freezing wintry cold, where she finds that she must share compartment number 6 with Vadim (Yuriy Borisov), a boorish, drunk young guy who is on his way to get a job in a coal mine in Murmansk and is openly abusive, misogynistic and philistine about Laura’s plans. And her phone calls back to Moscow reveal that Irina isn’t exactly pining for her. Of course, it isn’t too much of a stretch to see that after their meet-uncute, the relationship of Vadim and Laura is going to thaw. The romance that flowers between these two young people is in parallel with the romance of a long rail journey, and this is a very non-American equivalent of Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise movies. Vadim’s scowling face and shaven, bullet head make him look a tough guy at first, but it isn’t long before we see him as a vulnerable little boy, never more so than when with Laura welcomes another Finnish guy to share their carriage - a self-admiringly sensitive type who insists on singing and playing his guitar. Vadim is fiercely sceptical and resentful of this preening interloper, and he is right to be. In the end, no one wants to help Laura find these petroglyphs that she has set her heart on and travelled so far to see, and it is Vadim himself who has to step up; there is charm and gentleness in this scene and the movie as a whole. • Compartment No 6 is released on 8 April in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
Dining across the divide: ‘I was ignorant about trans people. Now I have a better understanding’,2022-04-07T11:30:01Z,Zoe Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/p/yxq2h,"Ada, 38, Witney, Oxfordshire Occupation In the third year of an adult nursing MSc Voting record In the US, always Democrat; has yet to vote in a UK general election Amuse bouche While serving in the US military, Ada was logistics commander for Barack Obama at a G7 summit Rebecca, 61, near Watford, Hertfordshire Occupation Retired anaesthetist Voting record Labour in every general election bar 2019 Amuse bouche Rebecca does large-format photography, with an old-fashioned bellows camera with a black cloth over her head For starters Rebecca Ada looked like a well-presented young woman, and she’s very pleasant, nice and open. Ada One of the reasons I wanted to do this is because I live in a sheltered, middle-class area of Oxfordshire. I don’t even have a gay person who’s a friend where I live. I wanted to expand my horizons, so having a pleasant lunch with Rebecca was just the ticket. Rebecca As a trans person, I think about this: are there lots of anti-trans people, or just a small number of very vocal ones? Can trans people overreact? Yes, of course, sometimes. Ada I had the calamari and then a fish pie. Rebecca Oh gosh, I had steak and chips. I don’t know why I chose it – my daughter’s a vegan so I wouldn’t normally. The big beef Ada I think self-identification is fine. I don’t believe in the trope that people are going to self-identify as the other sex so they can commit crimes. My beef is with sports. I’m afraid that it’s very one-sided – trans women, especially in America, are starting to take part in athletics, and rarely the other way around. You don’t see many trans men participating in men’s soccer. I’m sorry, but it’s not fair. Rebecca I can totally get why that’s an issue. But also, is it not everyone’s right to take part in sport? So it’s not straightforward. Trans people don’t want to destroy women’s sport, as a whole. I wouldn’t want to. I do parkruns, and I put down female. I’ve probably knocked somebody from 500th place to 501st. Should I have put down my natal gender? Ada I think my viewpoint has mellowed somewhat, because of my degree. I had to do a project recently on a trans patient. As a future nurse, I could very well be treating a person from this community. And as I looked into the research, it’s given me more perspective. Rebecca Trans rights have become a symbol of culture wars, and we’re caught in the middle of all this. If the media starts framing trans people as bad people, and putting them at the centre of bad events, it’s like making out gay people are all sexual predators. Has any trans person ever done anything wrong? Well, of course they have, because they’re also human. Sharing plate Ada Just like everybody else, I thought the EU referendum was nothing to worry about. Just like with Trump at the time, I thought: it’ll be fine. People surely won’t vote for this. Rebecca I am very anti-Brexit. I still feel angry about the way things were manipulated by the leave campaign. I thought there were unpleasant aspects to it, racist aspects. At the end of the day, whatever I think, a vote is a vote, and there was a majority vote. You respect that. But I feel very sad. For afters Ada I blame my Americanness for this, maybe, but I do not get the royal family. So they bring in a lot of money, but they cost a lot, too. There are so many other things to spend it on than keeping up this ridiculous institution. People who are in a position of power because they happen to be born into a family … I just don’t get it. Rebecca I’m a British republican, but I wouldn’t get up and march to get rid of the royal family. My view is that it’s connected to having a House of Lords – I’d rather have an elected upper chamber and no inherited rights. Takeaways Ada Based on the few things that I’d seen and heard, I did have a really ignorant outlook on trans people. Now that I’ve met Rebecca, I think I have a much better understanding of the struggle that they go through. Rebecca She was a very open-minded, centred person with her feet on the ground.

Florence + the Machine’s 20 best songs – ranked!,2022-04-07T11:25:03Z,Michael Cragg,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7kvd,"20 Moderation (2019) “Do I look moderate to you?” asks the never-knowingly subtle Florence Welch rhetorically on this James Ford-produced one-off single. Opening with bar-room piano stabs, it soon blossoms into a galloping rocker, Welch battling an inner voice suggesting she perhaps rein it in. Needless to say she doesn’t listen. 19 Wish That You Were Here (2016) Welch’s windswept wail and penchant for atmospheric harp flutters have made her catnip for fantastical film soundtracks. On this undulating, near seven-minute epic, taken from Tim Burton’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, Welch mourns relationships fractured by constant touring. “I wanted to go home, to be where you are,” she roars as drums crash like angry waves. 18 Big God (2018) On 2018’s fourth album High As Hope, Welch and her evolving studio cohorts (the more static ‘+ the Machine’ are for live shows) sought to dial down the bluster. On the experimental, relatively stripped back Big God – co-written by Jamie xx – Welch prowls around a loping piano figure, before a meandering sax solo from Kamasi Washington slowly takes over. 17 Never Let Me Go (2011) After the ubiquitous success of debut album Lungs, Welch fast-tracked its follow-up Ceremonials, decamping to Abbey Road studios with producer Paul Epworth. While Lungs skipped around genres mischievously, the opulent Ceremonials focused more on widescreen chamber pop, with the Halo-esque Never Let Me Go a prime example of refined excess. 16 Sky Full of Song (2018) High As Hope’s lead single feels like a soft caress in comparison to the usual cold, hard slap of a big chart-facing hit. Lyrically it ponders the paradox of performing live, exploring the huge highs that only temporarily pierce moments of strange isolation. “I thought I was flying but maybe I’m dying tonight,” Welch sings softly over distant harp flutters. 15 Drumming Song (2009) While her early pop contemporaries Lily Allen and Adele turned relationships into soap operas and kitchen-sink dramas, Welch spun them into gothic fantasies. On Lungs’ propulsive fourth single, a new crush elicits the kind of high-wire emotions more akin to drowning, an exhausted Welch left “as empty as that beating drum”. 14 What the Water Gave Me (2011) Named after Frida Kahlo’s 1938 painting, Ceremonials’ more rock-leaning promotional single (AKA the one before the proper single), finds Welch returning to a lyrical trope; trying to understand the vastness of something too enormous to understand. Here she is overwhelmed by bodies of water, a place both beautiful and deadly. 13 South London Forever (2018) Created at the start of her 30s, High As Hope excels when Welch looks back at her youth with misty-eyed clarity. Over airy production, here she half-remembers nights spent holding hands with strangers “high on E”, and relishes in the false certainty of “it doesn’t get better than this”. Later, as the song starts to wrestle with itself, Welch snaps: “Oh God, what do I know?” 12 King (2022) Around the two-minute 45 seconds mark of this first single from next month’s Dance Fever, Welch unleashes an almighty, wordless roar, as if making it very clear that High As Hope’s sonic retreat was an anomaly. From there the song keeps building, like a raging fire fuelled by the opening verse’s slow burn anger at societal expectations placed on women. 11 Sweet Nothing (2012) In 2012, Welch dipped her toe in EDM’s WKD-coloured waters not once but twice, with Calvin Harris first sending a remix of Ceremonials’ Spectrum to No 1. Three months later she was back with Harris at the top on this gloriously sugary confection, Welch sounding as if she’s having the time of her life while Harris unleashes a rapid-fire electronic blitzkrieg around her. 10 Dog Days Are Over (2008) Like most songs on Lungs, this single’s appeal has been dampened slightly by its ubiquity. There was a time in 2010 where you couldn’t shop, watch TV or wander around a festival field without hearing its opening harp trills, or that thumping chorus. Still, taken at a distance, it remains a glorious head-rush of emotions, Welch barely keeping up with its galloping ecstasy. 9 No Light, No Light (2011) A lot of second album Ceremonials teeters on the brink of self-parody, with everything turned up to 11. On the sky-scraping No Light, No Light, Welch revels in the OTT, swishing around cascading choirs and harps before ditching her highfalutin lyrical tropes in favour of direct emotion: “Would you leave me if I told you what I’d done?” she asks during the song’s majestic bridge. 8 My Love (2022) New album Dance Fever’s latest single finds Welch trying to find inspiration in a world locked down (“my arms emptied, the skies emptied” she panics in the song’s finale). What started as an acoustic “sad little poem” has been buffed by Glass Animals’ Dave Bayley into a pensive banger, all propulsive dance rhythms and tentative exaltation. 7 What Kind of Man (2015) By third album How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, Welch et al had reached festival headline status, a fact underlined months later at Glastonbury. On the album’s combative lead single, the pretty harp flourishes of old are swapped for rugged guitar riffs, with Welch utilising distinctly masculine rock tropes to admonish a useless man. 6 Shake It Out (2011) In 2011, Florence + the Machine were big enough to be handed a coveted performance slot on The X Factor, a nod to Welch’s vocal influence on a plethora of “kooky” young hopefuls. They performed this maximalist baroque pop rager, which finds Welch trying to shake an almighty hangover by exorcising it from her body by sheer force alone. 5 Cosmic Love (2009) Another song created on a hangover, Lungs’ sixth single takes a classic subject – being really really in love – and straps it to a rocket aimed at the moon. There is not an ounce of subtlety on display here (its firework-esque harp coda is joined by the sound of actual fireworks, for example), which only makes its youthful, cartwheeling exuberance all the more accurate. 4 St Jude (2015) Across How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful’s 11 tracks, Welch invokes various characters, from Persephone to the Virgin Mary. On the delicate St Jude, which strips everything back to Welch’s pin-sharp voice and a distant electronic rumble, she references both the “patron saint of the lost causes” and the 2013 storm that shared her name. Somewhere in the middle sits perhaps her most genuinely affecting song. 3 Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up) (2009) Written at the behest of her label, who asked Welch for something more upbeat to balance out Lungs’ darker fare, Rabbit Heart bristles with the fear that comes with reaching the point of no return. Aware she was about to dive into fame’s chasm, the song’s lyrics abound with sacrificial imagery (“Who is the lamb and who is the knife?”), all wrapped up in sprightly production that gave the band their first proper hit. 2 Hunger (2018) Written initially as a private poem, High As Hope’s second single strips away any artifice and explores Welch’s relationship with drink and drugs (she’s been sober since 2014), and her teenage eating disorder. “At 17 I started to starve myself,” she sings, a bracing opening that’s soon warmed by the chorus’ light-footed melody and Welch’s sage reflections on the complex beauty of “vibrant youth”. 1 Ship to Wreck (2015) While making How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, Welch has said producer Markus Dravs told her to stop writing songs about water. Thankfully, she ignored him, with the album’s lead single – a galloping mix of acoustic guitar, hammond organ and glockenspiel – likening a broken relationship to a battered ship being washed up on the shore. Throughout Welch conjures up images of great white sharks and killer whales to represent her demons, continuing her philosophy of never writing small songs about big emotions. By the glorious middle eight, Welch’s propensity for self-destruction has fully taken hold: “We are lost, and into the breach, we got tossed,” she sings, “And the water is coming in fast”. Ruin never sounded so wonderful. • Dance Fever is released on 13 May."
Labour says Rishi Sunak must ‘come clean’ about wife’s non-dom tax status,2022-04-07T08:59:26Z,Peter Walker and Aubrey Allegretti,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nkt,"Labour has called for clarity over why Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, uses non-domicile status, as Keir Starmer said it would be “breathtaking hypocrisy” if she had been reducing her tax liabilities while the chancellor was raising taxes on others. Murty receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from a stake in her family’s IT business empire, Infosys, which is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and listed on the Indian and New York stock exchanges. Under UK tax laws, Murty’s status as a non-dom means she does not have to pay tax on dividend payments from overseas companies. As of Wednesday, UK resident taxpayers in the highest income band pay a 39.35% tax on dividend payouts. After her status was revealed by the Independent a spokesperson for Murty said that because she was a citizen of India, which does not allow Indians to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously, she “is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”. They added: “She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.” However, tax experts have said non-dom status is not automatic but a choice. Prof Richard Murphy, a Sheffield University academic who co-founded the Tax Justice Network, said: “Domicile has nothing to do with a person’s nationality. In other words, the claims made in the statement issued by Ms Murty are wrong, and as evidence, just because a person has Indian citizenship will never automatically grant them non-dom status in the UK.” The Labour MP Chris Bryant said the statement needed to be clarified: “This is just wrong. Non-dom status is not automatic and the Treasury needs to urgently clarify this inaccurate statement. “After shutting down legitimate questions about Infosys and its operations in Russia last week, it’s time for Rishi Sunak to come clean.” Starmer said Sunak “has very, very serious questions to answer”. The Labour leader told Sky News that Sunak had repeatedly raised taxes: “He says all of this is necessary, there’s no option. If it now transpires that his wife has been using schemes to reduce her own tax, then I’m afraid that is breathtaking hypocrisy. “We need complete transparency on this, so that we can all understand what schemes she may have been using to reduce her own tax.” Earlier, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, insisted that the chancellor and his his wife had been “incredibly transparent” about the arrangement, but was unable to say whether she paid tax on foreign earnings in India or another jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “She’s an Indian citizen. And so she, as you say, pays tax here on UK income, but pays tax abroad on foreign income.” But asked where she paid tax abroad – in India or elsewhere such as the Cayman Islands – Kwarteng said: “I don’t know anything about her tax affairs. “What I do know is that she’s been very clear about the fact that she’s an Indian citizen. Once she’s lived here for 15 years, the non-domicile status falls away. So that will happen in a few years. I don’t know when. “And she’s been very transparent about that. The chancellor has been incredibly transparent in the declaration of interests when he became a minister. “The Treasury, the department which he works in, knows about all those affairs. And there is a measure of transparency and he’s been very honest about that. And I think, as far as I’m concerned, that’s good enough for me. And I think we should move on from that story.” Earlier, Kwarteng told Times Radio that non-domicile status had existed in the UK “for more than 200 years”. He said: “That’s something that’s been well established … I think there’s a lot of malicious attacks on someone who, after all, is a private citizen and is not a politician.” A representative for Murty was contacted for comment."
Most carers like me haven’t had a break since 2020 – it’s a scandal in plain sight,2022-04-07T10:53:38Z,Yasmin Qureshi,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y6da6,"It was 3am in the early hours of a Monday morning. I awoke to a phone call from my brother gasping for breath and struggling with chest pains in another room of my house. I rushed to his side and called an ambulance that took him to hospital. The next few hours were spent anxiously waiting to hear from doctors, who would eventually refer him to a specialised care unit. This was just one of several emergencies where, as his carer, I found myself navigating the complexities of his chronic conditions while watching the gradual demise of his health. Bleary eyed and sleep deprived, I left home later that morning and began the three-hour commute from my constituency in Bolton to my office in the House of Commons. For much of my time as an MP, I have been a carer. First, for my elderly mother, Sakina, who passed away in 2017, during the general election campaign, and more recently for my brother. I am just one of as many as 11.5 million carers in the UK who provide support to family members each day. Yet so many stories go untold, perhaps because sharing these struggles openly can be difficult. The reality is that half of us, by the age of 50, will find ourselves assuming responsibility for someone who cannot care for themselves. Most will not be able to afford outsourcing care to a nursing home or paid care workers – so they will be solely responsible for looking after their loved one. But despite unpaid carers providing an estimated £193bn of free labour a year, carer’s allowance remains the lowest paid benefit of its kind: a mere £67.60 a week for a minimum of 35 hours’ care. It is a scandal. Caring for someone you love is a privilege, but one that is fraught with the emotional and physical exhaustion of always being on call, alongside much personal sacrifice, anguish and sorrow. My parents had instilled in me a “no time for self-pity: just get on with it!” attitude to life. And I gave way to that kind of stoicism with my mother, when I had to reconcile that her several chronic conditions would probably never improve, and the time I had left with her was incredibly precious. I am lucky to have support from a local provider in the form of a social care plan. This provides a care worker to stand in for me when I’m away representing my constituents in Westminster, but with the social care system in crisis, many do not have this option – and they are being left to manage entirely without support by a government that is not only undermining but ignoring them. We urgently need a radical overhaul of social care and our attitudes towards unpaid care in Britain. I recently asked the health secretary about the number of unpaid carers, the help available to them and his plans for respite care. The minister was unable to answer any of my questions, although the government claimed that it is investing money in understanding the role unpaid carers play in our social care system. But we need to act much quicker and to properly support those who give so much, for so little in return. Carers UK reported in June 2021 that 72% of carers had not had a break since the pandemic began – and they were exhausted. For those caring for relatives who, like my brother, have a host of health issues that require regular hospital visits or prolonged hospital stays, it has meant two years in a near constant state of social isolation – owing to the frightful pressure of taking extra precautions to prevent the risk of infection. There are some organisations offering help, such as Carefree, which offers carers a night away at a partner hotel, free of charge, bar a small admin fee. This is a great initiative, but surely it is the government that should be providing a route to respite care. The NHS and the social care system would certainly have collapsed without unpaid carers, yet they receive so little public support or government praise – other than the cynical clap for carers during the pandemic. For too long, local authorities have had their social care budgets slashed, forcing services to be downgraded. The social care budget has long been looked upon as a cash cow, there to make huge savings without ever considering the human impact. Carers are now only really able to “pop in” for a flying visit, quickly making some tea and food, and having a brief chat, before they have to leave for their next appointment. This was all too clear in Ed Balls’ documentary Inside the Care Crisis. The government must look towards a home-first policy. This means providing support in people’s homes, allowing those who are elderly, clinically vulnerable or disabled the long-term dignity we all deserve. This is especially important in the case of patients who, like my brother, are on dialysis. Boris Johnson began his premiership by claiming he would provide a “plan to fix social care once and for all” – which we are yet to see. So long as the government continues to avoid this crucial issue, it is unpaid carers and those in need who will continue to suffer. Yasmin Qureshi is the Labour MP for Bolton South East"
BBC blocked from naming alleged MI5 informant accused of abusing women,2022-04-07T10:52:31Z,Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z5h,"The BBC has been banned from identifying a “dangerous extremist and misogynist” who is allegedly an MI5 informant, after a high court judge granted an injunction. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, successfully blocked the identification of the alleged informant, or covert human intelligence source (Chis), referred to as X throughout the proceedings. One woman told the BBC that X had used his status as an agent to abuse, control and coerce her and that MI5 must have known about his behaviour. Another said he might murder someone unless he was exposed. In a ruling on Thursday, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the evidence he had seen, in open court and in closed hearings, had convinced him the injunction was necessary. “The attorney is more likely than not to succeed at trial in establishing that the balance of public and private interests favours the grant of relief prohibiting the BBC from disclosing X’s name and image,” he said. “The BBC will still be able to convey what it regards as the core elements of its story, including the allegation that X abused his Chis status and the allegation that MI5 is at fault for using or continuing to use him as a Chis. The government will be heavily constrained in how it can respond to the latter allegation, but the constraints can be explained.” The BBC went to court this month to try to stop an injunction against a report that would have identified the MI5 agent. The corporation claimed the agent used his status to abuse two ex-partners, and said naming him was in the public interest. The government said identifying him posed a risk to his life and national security. Large parts of a two-day case were heard in closed proceedings, which the BBC was not allowed to attend. The BBC claimed that X used his status as an agent to abuse, control and coerce a former partner, referred to by the pseudonym Beth, and that MI5 either knew or ought to have known about this and was wrong to use him as an agent. Another woman, known by the pseudonym Ruth, who alleges she was abused by X, has said she fears he will kill a woman if he is not “challenged and exposed”. Braverman sought an injunction to block the broadcast, arguing that identifying X would create a “real and immediate risk” of serious or life-threatening harm to him and would damage national security. Lawyers representing Braverman said she “neither confirms nor denies” the BBC’s claim that X is an agent or Chis, but was conducting the hearing on the “hypothetical assumption” that he is or was. The BBC’s legal team told the court: “Beth and Ruth have an intimate insight into X’s psyche and behaviour, making them uniquely placed to evaluate the risk that he poses to other women.” David Pannick, representing the broadcaster, said: “He told one of those women, who we call Beth, that he worked for MI5 in order to terrorise her, in order to control her. The programme will say that MI5 should have known about his behaviours and realised that it was not appropriate to [have] used him as a Chis.” He told the court there was a “particularly strong public interest” in the story given the “current context of public debate” on coercive control of women by male partners. There was “simply no cogent evidence to justify a conclusion that X is at serious risk of serious harm or death” if he is identified, Lord Pannick said. In a witness statement, Beth said: “I think X is a very dangerous individual – to me, to ex-partners and to other women. He thinks it’s OK to treat women the way that he’s treated me. I believe he must be named and identified to the public at large to warn others.” Ruth said in a statement: “I consider that he is dangerous enough to kill a woman and I fear that he will do so if he is not challenged and exposed. I think it is crucial that other women know his identity and what he looks like, so that he cannot trick and harm them.” Sir James Eadie QC, for the attorney general, said: “Publication of the report would constitute a breach of confidence/false confidence by the BBC. To do so would damage national security and the public interest. It would also create a real and immediate risk of serious or life-threatening harm to X.” The attorney general argued there was no objection to a broadcast about the allegations against X and MI5’s use of agents that did not identify him, but claimed that identifying him would be a breach of confidence and infringe X’s human rights. In a statement issued after the ruling, the BBC said the judgment did not prevent it from reporting “key elements” of its story once restrictions are determined, but said the use of “secret procedures” constrained what the judge was able to say about his decision. A spokesperson for the broadcaster said: “The BBC does not fully know the reasons why [identification of X presents a risk to national security] and nor will the public. This is due to the highly unusual fact that a significant proportion of the evidence in this case was heard in a closed hearing, which even the BBC as a party was not permitted to attend. “While we had ‘special advocates’ representing our interests in those closed proceedings, we are not able to know anything about the secret hearing. The reasons the BBC is not able to identify X are largely in the closed judgment, which we cannot inspect. “The secret procedures used in cases like this also constrain what the judge is able to say about his decision in the public judgment. They are a significant departure from the principles of open and natural justice, as the judge himself states.” A spokesman for the attorney general’s Office said: “We welcome today’s judgment.”"
Scott Morrison in damage control in South Australia over submarine comments,2022-04-07T10:40:51Z,Daniel Hurst and Sarah Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7n7q,"Scott Morrison is moving to head off an electoral backlash in South Australia after the prime minister appeared to water down the government’s commitment to building Aukus nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. As he prepares to formally trigger the federal election campaign within days, Morrison was forced into damage control on Thursday, reassuring South Australian voters about his support for domestic shipbuilding jobs. The new South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, fired a warning shot, saying the Liberals had a track record of “delays and broken promises” and he would “not accept anything less” than the submarines being built in Adelaide. “My position is clear: the submarines must be built in Adelaide and South Australia must get the jobs we have been promised for years and years,” the Labor premier told Guardian Australia. South Australian federal Liberal MPs also said they expected the government to honour its commitment. The pre-election Aukus controversy stems from Morrison’s response on Wednesday when asked to guarantee that each of the new submarines – other than the nuclear reactor – would be built in Australia. Morrison gave a qualified answer. “Well, we’re working through all of those issues and that is certainly our intention to maximise all of that,” he told reporters in western Sydney. The prime minister went on to emphasise the need for speedy delivery. “But it’s also the paramount goal is to ensure we get that capability as soon as we can, and it’s in the best form that it can be working with our partners.” That was interpreted as a hint that a desire for shorter timeframes might trump local jobs when a decision is finalised early next year, and the issue was picked up by South Australian media outlets. In a sign of the Coalition’s political sensitivity over the issue, Morrison spoke to an Adelaide radio station on Thursday to insist his comments had been “twisted” in a “false and misleading” way. “I just want to put people’s minds at rest,” Morrison told radio FiveAA. “I mean, there’s no change to our policy here. We will build submarines in South Australia, and we will build as much of them in SA as we possibly can.” In the same interview, Morrison conceded there were “a lot of technical issues that we’ll have to work through” but said the desire to secure the capability as quickly as possible “doesn’t change our commitment to what we’re doing in South Australia, at all”. Pressed on whether he could quantify how much of the submarine would be built domestically, Morrison said: “Well, no one can. I mean, because we haven’t down-selected to the actual submarine.” When the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK was announced in September, the three countries launched an 18-month study into how Australia could achieve delivery of at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines. The Morrison government said at the time its intention was to build them in South Australia, although it never gave an iron-clad promise. It has yet to announce whether it prefers the US or the UK design, but has predicted the first submarines could be ready by the late 2030s. The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick and rival upper house contender Nick Xenophon both vowed to campaign to secure local jobs. “I do not believe that the prime minister is being honest with the Australian public,” Patrick said. He cited the government’s dumping of its previous pledge to build the Pacific Step Up vessel domestically on the basis it needed to acquire it more quickly. Xenophon, who is attempting a political comeback, said Morrison was trying to use a “gaudy velvet wallpaper to plaster over a wall full of cracks and holes because there is no plan at the moment”. He said advanced manufacturing jobs were at stake. The Liberals were already concerned about the marginal lower house seat of Boothby, but the party is now also worried the seat of Sturt – formerly held by Christopher Pyne – could be vulnerable in the event of a backlash. The Liberal MP for Sturt, James Stevens, who has a 6.9% margin, said the government had “always been crystal clear that our future submarines will be built in Adelaide” and he expected the commitment to be kept. Rowan Ramsey, the Liberal MP for the safe seat of Gray, said South Australian members were “not always in lockstep with everything but we are lockstep on this one”. “The commitment is to build the subs in SA and that is what we expect to happen,” Ramsey said. The government also faces renewed scrutiny over the cost of the abandoned French diesel-electric submarine project. Defence officials told Senate estimates they expected the yet-to-be-completed settlement with French contractor Naval Group could be met from within the existing budget. About half of the $5.5bn in previously approved funding has already been spent. Morrison has defended the costs, saying Australia needed the less easily detectible nuclear-powered submarines: “The Plan B I had was better than Plan A.”"
International Booker prize shortlist delivers ‘awe and exhilaration’,2022-04-07T10:30:00Z,Lucy Knight,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7jtb,"From Olga Tokarczuk’s epic about a man who claimed to be the messiah to Geetanjali Shree’s tale of a widow finding a new lease of life, female writers take the majority of places on this year’s International Booker prize shortlist. Of the six books now in contention for the prestigious translated fiction award, five were written by women, with three translated by women too. The International Booker goes to “the finest fiction from around the world” that has been translated into English, awarding a cash prize of £50,000, which is split equally between author and translator. After reading 135 books, the judges chose six titles from six different languages, all of which “explore the borders and boundaries of human experience”, according to chair of judges Frank Wynne. “As a jury we have had the pleasure of reading many extraordinary books,” said Wynne. “Choosing a shortlist from among them has been difficult and sometimes heartbreaking.” The titles he selected alongside fellow judges Merve Emre, Petina Gappah, Viv Groskop and Jeremy Tiang “offer glimpses of literature from around the world,” he said. “But they all share a fierce and breathtaking originality that is a testament to the endless inventiveness of fiction.” Nobel laureate Tokarczuk and her translator Jennifer Croft previously won the prize in 2018 for Flights. They are now in with a chance of a second win for the 900-page The Books of Jacob, which Wynne compared to the Bayeux tapestry, such is its magnificence – “but probably about a mile and a half longer”. Meanwhile Tomb of Sand by Shree and her translator Daisy Rockwell is the first Hindi book to have made the shortlist in the prize’s 17-year history. The judges praised its “constantly shifting perspectives and timeframes”, calling it “loud and irresistible”. The Books of Jacob and Tomb of Sand are up against the “genre-defying” collection of short stories Cursed Bunny by Bora Chung, translated from Korean by Anton Hur and Heaven, a haunting tale of teenage violence, by Mieko Kawakami, translated from Japanese by Samuel Bett and David Boyd. The judges called Heaven “an intense, claustrophobic novel” which uses its story of school bullying to enact Nietzsche’s critique of morality. “The power of Sam Bett and David Boyd’s translation lies in its ability to communicate both Mieko Kawakami’s abstract, philosophical ideas and her harrowing human drama”, they said. Completing the lineup are Elena Knows, Claudia Piñeiro’s part-crime novel, part-morality tale, translated from Spanish by Frances Riddle, and A New Name: Septology VI-VII by Jon Fosse, translated from Norwegian by Damion Searls. The judges said the final instalment of Fosse’s Septology series “draws together art, death and the idea of God with a vast, gentle grace”. As usual, the shortlist is dominated by independent publishers. Tilted Axis and Honford Star, which publish Tomb of Sand and Cursed Bunny respectively, have had books nominated for the prize for the first time this year. This year also marks the first time a translator has chaired the judging panel. “Translation is an intimate, intricate dance that crosses borders, cultures and languages. There is little to compare to the awe and exhilaration of discovering a perfect pairing of writer and translator” said Wynne. Though he admitted that the judging process had at times been “harrowing”, he said that announcing the shortlist on the same day as his 60th birthday was “the best present I’ve had”. The winner of the 2022 prize will be announced on 26 May."
Scientists find fossil of dinosaur ‘killed on day of asteroid strike’,2022-04-07T10:28:58Z,Kevin Rawlinson,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7z22,"Scientists believe they have been given an extraordinary view of the last day of the dinosaurs after they discovered the fossil of an animal they believe died that day. The perfectly preserved leg, which even includes remnants of the animal’s skin, can be accurately dated to the time the asteroid that brought about the dinosaurs’ extinction struck Earth 66m years ago, experts say, because of the presence of debris from the impact, which rained down only in its immediate aftermath. “It’s absolutely bonkers,” said Phillip Manning, a professor of natural history at the University of Manchester. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the thescelosaurus leg discovered at the Tanis dig site in North Dakota was the “ultimate dinosaur drumstick”. He said: “The time resolution we can achieve at this site is beyond our wildest dreams … This really should not exist and it’s absolutely gobsmackingly beautiful. I never dreamt in all my career that I would get to look at something a) so time-constrained; and b) so beautiful, and also tells such a wonderful story.” The dig has been filmed for a BBC documentary Dinosaurs: The Final Day with Sir David Attenborough; during which the broadcaster will review the fossil finds. “When Sir David looked at ‘[the leg], he smiled and said ‘that is an impossible fossil’. And I agreed,” Manning said. He said the team had also discovered the remains of fish that had breathed in impact debris from the asteroid strike, which occurred 1,864 miles (3,000km) away in the Gulf of Mexico. That and the presence of other debris that rained down for a specific period immediately after the asteroid strike allowed them to date the site much more accurately than standard carbon dating techniques. Robert DePalma, the University of Manchester graduate student who is leading the Tanis dig, said: “We’ve got so many details with this site that tell us what happened moment by moment, it’s almost like watching it play out in the movies. You look at the rock column, you look at the fossils there, and it brings you back to that day.” The BBC reported that the team had also found the fossilised remains of a turtle that was skewered by a wooden stake and small mammals and their burrows, as well as skin from a triceratops, a pterosaur embryo inside its egg and what scientists think could be a fragment from the asteroid impactor itself."
Is the world’s most important climate legislation about to die in US Congress?,2022-04-07T10:19:10Z,Daniel Sherrell,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ytz,"On April 23, the day after Earth Day, a big tent coalition—climate activists, union workers, civil rights leaders, and increasingly desperate young people—will be gathering outside the White House. If you live on the eastern seaboard and are free that Saturday, you should sign up and join them. Here’s why: Tucked beneath the headlines on Covid and Ukraine, the most important climate legislation in US history – and thus, arguably, in world history – is still stuck in Congressional purgatory. You’d be forgiven if you weren’t fully aware. It is not trending on Twitter. President Biden has mostly stopped talking about it. The enormous moral stakes have been brutally ablated by a broken, farcical, and, above all, extremely boring legislative kludge known as budget reconciliation. The months-long saga has turned Biden’s original “Build Back Better” plan into the juridical equivalent of a Warhol soup can – a ubiquitous token evacuated of any original meaning. That the public has largely failed to track the world-historical implications of this process is an indictment of the way climate information gets filtered down to ordinary people: in dollar figures no one understands, in line graphs published by obscure wonks on Twitter, in front page headlines that exhaust the emotive potential of journalistic prose. Connecting any of this to, for example, insurance premiums in Miami Beach, or the fate of the world’s remaining sea turtles, or the prospect of your own grandchildren spending the bulk of their crypto-wages on potable drinking water requires an almost mimetic leap of imagination. And yet, the stakes remain what they are. Passage of the bill’s half-trillion dollars-worth of clean energy investments would likely spell the difference between the world’s largest economy meeting its climate goals and blowing right past them. It is not an exaggeration to say that in that balance—between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius of warming, between a government responsive to and avoidant of the greatest crisis of the 21st century – hang millions of human lives. The potential impact rivals that of nuclear war, except in this case the default is catastrophe. The fossil fuel industry has already fired its ICBM at the heart of our coastal cities. It’s up to the Democrats now to turn it around. And turn it around they still might. Joe Manchin, of his own volition, has returned to the bargaining table with a proposal that could retain most of the original climate investments from Build Back Better and potentially leave room for some investment in low-emission home and health care work. Biden and Schumer must stop at nothing to hold him to his word and land the deal. If they do, they could reverse the narrative of Biden’s presidency overnight. Not only would Biden finally be able to declare victory on his signature policy agenda, he would be offering a direct rejoinder to the crisis in Ukraine, pointing global energy markets toward wind and solar and undercutting fossil-fueled autocrats like Vladimir Putin. For a war-time president, the combination of crisis-response and long-term vision would earn him a place next to Churchill in the history textbooks. To be clear, I am profoundly angry that it’s all come to this. That not a single one of the Republican cowards who claim concern over climate change – Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham – is even considering voting for the bill. That it’s fate will be determined by a man who makes money hand over fist pumping carbon into the atmosphere. That President Biden had to dispatch the head of the National Economic Council to go zip-lining with Manchin in West Virginia last weekend. That the fate of organized human civilization would at least partially depend on two grown men donning intricate safety harnesses and skimming across a river gorge (though I’ll admit that, compared to your typical round of golf, there was something weird and almost endearing about this particular political mating ritual). All of which is to say: I won’t let my indignation die. I won’t succumb to the Stockholm Syndrome of the Beltway pundit, who would tell my generation that this is just how Washington works. The point is that Washington doesn’t work. Washington is broken. This process is proof. But to refuse cynicism is not to refuse strategy. That’s why, on April 23, thousands of people will be showing up in front of the White House – and in key Senate swing states – to make one last play at redemption. That’s why, at the risk of repeating myself, you really should join them. Democrats still have a chance to deliver big on climate. If they fail, we’ll lose far, far more than the midterms. We cannot allow them to fail. Daniel Sherrell is the author of Warmth: Coming of Age at the End of Our World (Penguin Books) and a climate activist"

"UK’s energy strategy may take years to bring down bills, says Kwarteng",2022-04-07T10:16:24Z,Aubrey Allegretti Political correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7zx9,"Boris Johnson’s new energy strategy could take up to five years to start shaving money off people’s bills, the business secretary has admitted, as the prime minister announced a drastic expansion of nuclear reactors. Kwasi Kwarteng said the plan for cutting reliance on imported energy in the wake of spiralling prices caused in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was more of a medium-term way to ramp up homegrown energy production. Johnson declared that the long-delayed energy security strategy meant “nuclear is coming home” – but the review declined to set targets for onshore wind and committed to continuing the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. Days after 22 million people were hit by the energy price cap rising by 54%, Kwarteng suggested it would be years until the benefits of the strategy would be felt by consumers. “The strategy is more of a medium-term three, four, five-year answer,” the business secretary told Sky News. “I think it’s really important that we get an energy strategy that means we can have more security and independence in the years ahead. “We want to have security of supply, we want to live in a world where we’re not dependent on what Russian policy is, but we have more control over energy sources here in Britain.” The cost of offshore wind had decreased enormously in the past 10 years, Kwarteng said, adding: “Some of these benefits can happen quite quickly. But we need to start the planning process and the strategy now. And that’s what this security strategy is all about.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, attempted to intervene in the cost of living crisis at the end of March, but was accused of not doing enough to help struggling households expected to face the biggest fall in living standards since modern records began in the 1950s. At the heart of this week’s energy strategy was nuclear, and a commitment by the government to more than triple the amount of nuclear energy generated so that 25% of all Britain’s electricity comes from atomic energy. In a social media video to promote the strategy, Johnson said: “In the country that was the first to split the atom, the first truly to harness its power to light our homes and drive our factories, we will once again lead the way. “Nuclear is coming home. So instead of a new reactor every decade we will have a new reactor every year. “For years, governments have dodged the big decisions on energy, but not this one. We’ve got the ambition, we’ve got the plan and we are going to bring clean, affordable secure power to the people for generations to come.” Labour accused Johnson and Kwarteng of being “too weak” to follow through on their previously planned hopes to drastically increase the amount of onshore wind production because of hostility from Tory backbenchers. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said a significant majority of people supported onshore wind. Pat McFadden, the shadow Treasury chief secretary, also said Kwarteng’s comments about the time it would take for the energy strategy to start to bring down energy bills showed the government had “no plan to immediately address their cost of living crisis”. He reiterated Labour’s call for a one-off windfall tax on “the booming profits of oil and gas giants – which would reduce household bills by up to £600”."
"Cheers, drinks and tears: opening day at the bar where women’s sports reign",2022-04-07T10:00:12Z,Melanie Sevcenko in Portland,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7y46,"By 11am on opening day at Portland’s The Sports Bra, billed as the world’s first sports bar showing only women’s sports, a bustling queue had already filled the sidewalk. While members of the Pride Cheerleading Association shook pompoms in the parking lot, dozens of women – fans and athletes alike – waited to grab a seat and reach a milestone together. “I actually got emotional and cried when I walked in,” said Leslie Melin, who sat at the bar with a signature cocktail. “I’m so proud to be here.” The Sports Bra, which opened its doors in Oregon on 1 April, seeks to address a glaring gender imbalance in sports coverage. Although 40% of professional athletes are female, women’s sports make up only 4% of all sports media coverage, according to a Unesco study on gender equality. “Our approach is to take that 4% that is showing and put it on blast,” said Jenny Nguyen, the bar’s founder and owner. That message resonated with those who showed up for the kick-off. Jamie Orr – one of hundreds of backers who raised more than $100,000 on The Sports Bra’s Kickstarter campaign – made history by becoming its first customer. “To have a sports bar where you’re not going to have to fight to get the back TV turned on to a women’s game, it’s just great,” she said. “Hardly anyone knows the history of women’s football,” said Leah Hinkle, general manager of the Oregon Ravens, a team of the Women’s National Football Conference, whose games will be streamed at The Sports Bra. “But equity isn’t just about divvying up screen time,” added Hinkle. “Equity is about having what you need to succeed. Women’s sports need a movement and The Sports Bra is making a statement.” The statement starts with five television screens, mounted on walls adorned with framed jerseys and memorabilia from a swath of women’s teams. The bar has partnered with ESPN3 and media company Just Women’s Sports to stream a variety of programming, from games to original content. And during times when there are no women’s sports to broadcast or stream, the bar plans to turn the TVs off, to highlight the lack of coverage. “We use that weakness as a talking point to draw attention to it,” Nguyen said. “I would love to play 24-7 women’s sports in here, but it’s just not possible.” Opening weekend offered a host of matches, from pro golf to college softball. The bar also showed two games of the NCAA’s March Madness, the first since Sedona Prince’s viral TikTok video highlighted shocking inequality between men’s and women’s weights rooms, leading to an equity review and a host of changes at the college basketball tournament. For Sivan Nadler, head of strategy at Just Women’s Sports, Nguyen’s concept gets to the heart of the matter. “There is a lot of language and marketing linked to empowerment and social good around women’s sports,” said Nadler. “And both of those things are important, but there’s not enough about the fact that these women are ballers. We want to see them play.” The seeds of The Sports Bra were planted four years ago when Nguyen and some friends watched a killer NCAA women’s championship at a local bar, on mute. Afterwards, Nguyen made an off-the-cuff remark: “You know, the only time we’re ever going to be able to watch a women’s game, with the sound on and all the fanfare, is if we had our own space.” A few days later she came up with the name and a cheeky slogan followed: We support women. Yet for years, The Sports Bra would remain a running joke among Nguyen and her friends. Whenever they found themselves frustrated by the lack of representation of women’s sports, they’d return to the safe space in their imagination and curate a playlist of games and even menu ideas. Eventually, as Nguyen faced a period of personal frustration marked by the Covid-19 pandemic and George Floyd’s murder, her girlfriend suggested she turn her dream of The Sports Bra into a reality. It was a risk, as droves of bars and restaurants were shuttered during lockdown, while new businesses were competing to snatch up hot real estate from the ashes. Rejected by the banks, Nguyen persevered with Kickstarter pledges and seed funding from friends and family. Food is an important part of the bar’s identity, and Nguyen’s too. It saved her life, so to speak, when her athletic career ended abruptly after she ruptured her ACL playing college basketball. Devastated, she turned to cooking and for the next 15 years worked her way up through Portland’s renowned culinary scene. The Sports Bra menu contains traditional pub grub with vegan-friendly options that uplift Nguyen’s Vietnamese heritage, including her mother’s famous clay-pot pork ribs and her aunt’s glazed chicken wings. Its message carries over to its vendors, sourcing beef, beverages and produce from women-owned companies in the community. Even its cocktails give a wink to women’s sports, including a gin drink called “Triple Axel” – a salute to Portland’s own Tonya Harding. Fixing the gender problem in sports coverage is bigger than simply opening a bar, but Nguyen hopes their mission can make a dent, one game at a time. Experts say building visibility is a key part of increasing young women’s participation in sports. According to the Women’s Sports Foundation, by the time a girl reaches 14 years of age, she’s twice as likely to drop out of sports compared with a boy. And if she’s LGBTQ+ or a person of color, the dropout rates double. It’s one reason why The Sports Bra is allowing minors into the space. Nguyen hopes that in the coming years, there might even be potential to franchise and expand. “I think that by giving women’s sports fans a physical location to celebrate, we can show the general public and mainstream media that there’s huge potential for growth and investment in women’s sports.”"
"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",2022-04-07T10:00:11Z,Guardian staff and agencies,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7y23,"Most American gun owners say they own firearms to protect themselves and their loved ones, but a study published this week suggests people who live with handgun owners are shot to death at a higher rate than those who don’t have such weapons at home. “We found zero evidence of any kind of protective effects” from living in a home with a handgun, said David Studdert, a Stanford University researcher who was the lead author of the Annals of Internal Medicine study. The study followed nearly 600,000 Californians who did not own handguns but began living in homes with handguns between October 2004 and December 2016, either because they started living with someone who owned one or because someone in their household bought one. It found that the absolute risk of living with a handgun owner was small, Studdert said, and that “the rates [of homicide] are low”. But it was important to consider the increase in a person’s risk of being killed, he added. The researchers calculated that for every 100,000 people in that situation, 12 will be shot to death by someone else over five years. In comparison, eight out of 100,000 who live in gun-free homes will be killed that way over the same time span. Those numbers suggest the risk rises 50%, but Studdert said it was actually higher: in a separate calculation designed to better account for where people live and other factors, the researchers estimated the risk was more than twice as high. In particular, the researchers found, people who lived with handgun owners had a much higher rate of being fatally shot by a spouse or intimate partner. The vast majority of such victims, 84%, were women, they said. Living with a handgun owner particularly increased the risk of being shot to death in a domestic violence incident, and it did not provide any protection against being killed at home by a stranger, the researchers found. People who lived with handgun owners “did not experience such fatal [stranger] attacks at lower rates than their neighbors in gun-free homes”, the researchers wrote, noting that stranger homicides at home were “a small minority” of the homicides observed in the study. The study focused only on homicide risk and did not examine how living with a handgun owner might increase or decrease the risk of being victimized in other ways, including by nonfatal assault, home invasion, or property theft. California is unusual in that it offers gun ownership data and other information not obtainable in almost any other state. That allowed the researchers to follow millions of people over many years to try to better establish what happened when a person began living in a home with a handgun, they said. The authors of the study acknowledged it had several shortcomings. For example, the researchers said they could not determine which victims had been killed by the handgun owners or with the in-home weapons. They couldn’t account for illegal guns and looked only at handguns, not rifles or other firearms. The dataset also was limited to registered voters in California who were 21 and older. It’s not clear that the findings are generalizable to the whole state, let alone to the rest of the country. But some outside experts said the work was well done, important and the largest research of its kind. “I would call this a landmark study,” said Cassandra Crifasi, a gun violence policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University. “This contributes to our understanding of the potential causal relationship between guns in the home and homicides.” The study was confined to California, but the risk was probably even greater in states with less stringent gun laws and where gun ownership was more common, Crifasi said. The results of the study come as the United States has experienced a dramatic increase in gun ownership during the pandemic. Previous research estimated that nearly 3% of US adults had become new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021, which translates to about 7.5 million Americans. Of those, about 5.4 million previously lived in a home with no guns. An early study of pandemic gun purchases found that there was no clear association between the increase in gun-buying and the increase in most kinds of interpersonal firearm violence in 2020, when a surge in gun violence drove a nearly 30% increase in the national murder rate. For decades, studies have shown guns in the home raise the risk of a violent death. Much of that work, including an earlier study by Studdert and his colleagues, focused on suicide. The new study goes further in addressing the perception that handguns are still worthwhile because of the safety they provide against being murdered, some experts said. “The reason people have guns in their home is for protection from strangers,” said David Hemenway, director of Harvard University’s Injury Control Research Center. “But what this is showing that having a gun in the home is bad for people in the home.”"
California cities spent huge share of federal Covid relief funds on police,2022-04-07T10:00:11Z,Sam Levin in Los Angeles,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7gxm,"Big cities in California spent large portions of their federal Covid relief money on police departments, a review of public records has revealed, with several cities prioritizing police funding by a wide margin. As part of the American Rescue Plan Act (Arpa), the Biden administration’s signature stimulus package, the US government sent funds to cities to help them fight coronavirus and support local recovery efforts. The money, officials said, could be used to fund a range of services, including public health and housing initiatives, healthcare workers’ salaries, infrastructure investments and aid for small businesses. But most large California cities spent millions of Arpa dollars on law enforcement. Some also gave police money from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (Cares) Act, adopted in 2020 under Donald Trump. The records show: San Francisco received $312m in Arpa funds for fiscal year 2020 and allocated 49% ($153m) to police, 13% ($41m) to the sheriff’s department, and the remainder to the fire department, according to the city controller. San Francisco also gave roughly 22% ($38.5m) of its Cares funds to law enforcement. Los Angeles spent roughly 50% of its first round of Arpa relief funds on the LAPD, according to a public records request by the controller candidate Kenneth Mejia, and first reported in local news site LA Taco. Fresno spent $36.6m of its Cares funds on the police, making up 67% of Cares spending on city salaries, and roughly 40% of all of Fresno’s Cares funds. San Jose allocated roughly $27.8m of its Cares and Arpa funds to police salaries and the police dispatch department, representing about 12% of its relief money. Long Beach allocated the majority of its $135.8 million Arpa funds to police, though a spokesperson said a detailed breakdown of funds was not available. Oakland allocated $5m (13.5%) of its Cares funds to police salaries; Sacramento allocated $2.2m (2.5%) of Cares funds to police; and San Diego spent roughly $60.1m (64%) of its Cares funds on police in fiscal year 2020, and $52.6m (33%) in fiscal year 2021. The budgeting and reporting process varies by city and is often opaque, making it difficult to compare and analyze how governments prioritized police and executed their budgets. In Fresno, the city allocated more than double of its Cares money to police than it did to Covid testing, contact tracing, small business grants, childcare vouchers and transitional housing combined. Oakland’s police allocation was greater than the amounts spent on a housing initiative, a small business grant program and a workforce initiative. San Jose, meanwhile, spent significantly more on housing services and food programs than on law enforcement. And although Long Beach initially reported that it was allocating 100% of its Arpa funds to police, a spokesperson said $11.8m of those funds were now going to direct relief grants and that a portion was also supporting the city’s parks and marine departments. Officials from Oakland and Anaheim both said that their Arpa awards were used as “revenue replacement” for their general fund, and said it was not possible to specify where the federal money went (though both cities typically spend large portions of their overall budgets on police, with Oakland going $22m over budget last year). A Bakersfield representative said $13.6m in Cares funds went to public safety, but did not specify how much of that went to police. Cities have explained their spending on police in a number of ways. In a report for the US government, Long Beach said police were “heavily involved in the City’s Covid-19 response”, including opening an emergency operations center and providing security at testing and vaccination sites. Stephen Walsh, Oakland’s controller, said that claiming Cares funds for the police was an “accounting strategy” and that the relief money wasn’t used to expand law enforcement, but rather to avoid cuts. He said this allowed the city to “pursue a great variety of worthy projects directed at Covid relief”. A spokesperson for the LA controller also said the Arpa funds were used for LAPD revenue that had previously been budgeted, and a representative for the LA city administrative officer said allocations for “public safety services” were “consistent with the intent of the funds”. Hillary Ronen, a member of the board of supervisors in San Francisco, noted that there were minimum staffing needs for the fire department and police, and that Covid cases in those departments forced cities to spend large amounts on public safety overtime. But she also said she appreciated the criticisms of the law enforcement allocations and that she wanted to see San Francisco invest in alternatives to police: “Over time, I do hope to shrink the budget of the police department.” Cities using relief funds for police have typically funneled the money to salaries, although The Appeal recently reported that some jurisdictions were using stimulus dollars to buy new surveillance technology and build new prisons. ‘Cities hide their police spending’ The data in California matches national trends. After the George Floyd uprisings sparked a national debate about the role of law enforcement and calls for the US to “defund the police” and reinvest those dollars in services, local governments across the US used Covid relief to maintain and expand law enforcement, including Chicago, Philadelphia and the state of Alabama. Meanwhile, the pressure to invest more in police is growing amid a rise in homicides and other crimes, even as the crime rate remains significantly lower than previous decades. The significant stimulus spending on police reflects the longstanding budget priorities in the US, where police spending has tripled over the last 40 years, with cities spending an increasing portion of their general funds on officers. Arpa allowed cities to replace lost revenue, so many of them funneled the relief to the agencies that previously received the most money. But in California, a state with severe income inequality and a dramatically worsening homelessness crisis, the stimulus spending has sparked backlash from community organizers who argue that the funds should have gone directly to civilians and that police should have accepted cuts. “It was called the ‘American Rescue Plan’, but you’re telling me that what needed to be rescued was the police department?” said Stephen “Cue” Jn-Marie, a pastor and activist at Skid Row in LA. “The city’s kneejerk reaction is always to use law enforcement to respond to everything … and the police forces keep getting larger.” “When the money is going toward law enforcement again, it’s just increasingly criminalizing those that need the most help,” said Hope Williams, an activist in San Francisco, referencing the escalating police crackdown on unhoused people suffering from addiction in the city. Williams, who has sued the police department over its treatment of protesters, added, “It’s exhausting and infuriating, but not surprising.” James Burch, policy director at the Anti Police-Terror Project, a coalition that organizes against police violence in Oakland, said it was frustrating how hard it was to get basic information on stimulus spending: “Cities like Oakland do everything they can to hide how much money they spend on policing, because if the public truly knew how much we spend on police and how little we spend on services, they would be infuriated.” In LA, the Arpa spending plan was not publicized until Kenneth Mejia, an accountant and advocate running for controller, filed a public records request with the current controller. Some other cities’ public reports have not directly mentioned police at all, categorizing the expenditures under “government services” or “payroll”. “It’s shocking and not at all transparent,” said Mejia, who has also uncovered how cannabis business taxes go to police. He further noted that LAPD was getting the funding at a time in 2021 when many of the department’s employees were declining to get vaccinated, with officers routinely caught on camera refusing to wear masks. “A city’s spending is representative of a city’s values … and you think that Covid relief money is going to help people, but it’s not. It’s going to police.”"

‘I felt worthless’: harassment and violence shut out female truckers amid driver shortage,2022-04-07T10:00:11Z,Bryce Covert,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y6z48,"In October 2020, Laura Zuniga got a call from a dispatcher at Eagle Trucklines. She would be picking up a load in Fresno, California, that morning and dropping it off in Florida that evening. She had never driven with the male colleague assigned to co-drive with her before, but said yes because she had recently graduated from training and needed the experience as well as the money. Zuniga drove first so the other driver could rest in one of the two beds in the back of the cab. But once they were on the road he kept coming to the front in his underwear. He asked her if she liked sex. Then he told her he wanted to pay her for sex. When she told him she wasn’t a sex worker, he claimed he was joking and returned to the back. When Zuniga eventually pulled over to take a nap, her co-driver repeatedly put his arm over her and got under her blanket. “Then I just remember him on top of me and trying to push me down,” she said. Her usual lightning-fast cadence slows and she chokes out the words, describing how she fought him as he pulled her pants down. He was naked. “His hands were everywhere,” she said. “I remember saying no, don’t, stop. And he doesn’t care, he’s smiling.” She called her dispatcher in tears, only to be told that she shouldn’t call the police, to just keep driving, so she did. But when her co-driver kept coming to the front and patting her on the head, Zuniga pulled over and called 911. “I just wanted to come home,” she said. Female truckers make up only 7% of the workforce, and in a recent study more that 90% reported experiencing at least one incident of sexual harassment in their careers. This, in addition to physically grueling conditions and falling pay, makes a profession that is hard for male truckers nearly impossible for women. As the world’s supply chain remains snarled, with shelves going bare and prices increasing, a lack of truck drivers comes into sharp focus. The American Trucking Association says that the industry is short 80,000 drivers, a number it warns could double within 10 years – a big problem for an industry that moves 72% of the country’s freight. Trucking used to be a solid middle class job, but when the industry was deregulated in the 1980s, the conditions cratered and compensation has gone down by 40%. Drivers often aren’t paid for the time they wait for goods to be loaded or unloaded, which can take hours, and are frequently classified as independent contractors and denied benefits and protections that regular employees enjoy. The largest companies have turnover rates of more than 90%, meaning that nearly everyone who starts out driving will leave within a year. If the trucking industry wants to close its driver shortfall, it can’t shut out half of the workforce. But that requires ending an epidemic of sexual abuse that spreads unchecked throughout the trucking industry, and that companies prioritize humane working conditions over ever-faster delivery times. When Zuniga told the dispatcher she had called the police, he was angry and worried about the load getting to its destination. By the time police arrived and filled out a report, her co-driver had fled on foot. Zuniga drove the truck to Arizona alone, dropped off the load, and drove back home to Fresno. After the incident, Eagle stopped calling her to work. The company didn’t pay her for the drive to Arizona. Her assailant, meanwhile, kept driving for Eagle for months afterward. Zuniga’s story is recounted in a lawsuit that she’s filed naming the company and the other trucker, alleging sexual and racial harassment and discrimination as well as sexual battery, wrongful termination, and a failure to pay her what she was owed. Eagle Trucklines has denied the allegations in the lawsuit, but has not responded to the Guardian’s request for comment. To date, Zuniga’s lawyer has been unable to find the other trucker and serve him with papers. “The way the company treated me, I felt worthless,” Zuniga said. Many of the factors that make sexual harassment more likely in any workplace proliferate in trucking. Sexual harassment is more common in heavily male-dominated workplaces, deployed as a way to show the few women that they aren’t welcome. Getting into trucking requires training, almost always from another driver, which creates a power imbalance because that person is a trainee’s ticket to graduation and certification. Most trucking companies hire entry-level workers to co-drive so that they can move products faster by trading off driving and sleeping. Out on the road, trainers decide when stops get made for showers or bathroom breaks. New drivers have to accumulate experience and money before they can own their own trucks, putting them once again at a disadvantage with the more experienced co-driver. Truckers are isolated on the road with their trainers and co-drivers, and they share a small space, including to sleep. Women may also be afraid to speak out about abuse and call attention to themselves and may not be taken seriously by the men they report to. Desiree Ann Wood is a truck driver and president of Real Women in Trucking. “The companies just basically push it under the rug,” she said, referring to sexual harassment. “They make the woman feel like she did something wrong.” Wood said many companies required a witness to an incident before they would investigate, which is next to impossible in trucking. It becomes a self-perpetuating cycle: with so few women in the industry they are frequently targeted for abuse, forcing them out of jobs that pay more than female-dominated service sector work. Other women who might consider entering may stay away, knowing the danger they could face. *** Zuniga, 39, had worked at a laundromat since 2016 and loved her job, but the pay was $11 an hour and she struggled to provide for her three daughters, ages 14, 12, and 10, often turning to public assistance programs and carrying credit card debt. “If I don’t have the money I feel like a horrible parent,” she said. She has long yearned to buy a house where her daughters can have their own rooms and a yard. She spotted an opportunity when she saw men pull into the shopping center where the laundromat is located in nice cars talking about buying houses. She found out they earned their money in trucking. When her co-worker Eunice went to trucking school in early 2019, Zuniga decided she should do the same, though she knew nothing about trucks. She started from scratch, memorizing the steps it takes just to start the engine. The learning curve was made harder by the reception from men who were the majority of trainers and fellow students. The trainers refused to give her a turn in the truck; it wasn’t until one offered to let her do it after hours that she was able to learn. It took her about six months to get the experience she needed to pass the test to graduate in October 2019. Then she started looking for a job. When Eunice started working with Eagle Trucklines and showed Zuniga her big paycheck, she signed up there, too. “I was thinking about the money,” she said. “I just wanted to work.” One week of driving a truck can net Zuniga $1,800-$1,900, which, despite her assault, makes it hard for her to leave the industry. “Every time I get in the truck I’m confident, I feel happy,” she said. “It feels good to work and have money.” But going on a long hauls means leaving her daughters with her elderly mother. “Every time I leave I feel like I don’t deserve my daughters,” she said. Her youngest always cries; her oldest tells her not to leave. She has missed birthdays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. “I feel like a horrible mother,” she said, “missing out on everything.” Since being assaulted, Zuniga is wary of trucking companies trying to take advantage of her in any way. She has left six jobs due to feeling cheated by her employers. She says they’ve undercounted the miles she’s driven, tried to make her drive on her days off, and pushed her to drive longer hours than the rules permit. She gets docked for being late even if it’s because of traffic or she needed to fuel up. She pees in a cup in the truck to save time. She left her most recent job after the company didn’t pay her on time. “I had I think $100 in my bank account,” she said. All the while, Zuniga is still dealing with the trauma of the assault. “My mind’s been messed up. I haven’t been the same,” she said. “I wish I had a button in my head I could just delete that.” She has lost hair and gained weight. She has nightmares, and her therapist has diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder. She feels like a puzzle missing a piece, “and I want my piece back.” She takes new precautions on the road now, carrying pepper spray, and drawing a hood up over her head and a mask to “feel safe”. If she could afford karate or boxing classes, she’d go, to “learn to kick them,” she said. “I’m always a happy person. I like to laugh, I like to talk,” she said. But after the assault, she lost her confidence. “I felt like he had taken something away from me.” Zuniga’s experience is, sadly, common. Sexual assault frequently leads to PTSD and other psychological effects, such as harms to self-esteem and what psychologists call safety schemas. “It damages the way you feel about the world and about yourself in the world,” said Louise Fitzgerald, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Illinois, who has worked on sexual harassment cases against truck companies. It disrupts victims’ sense of trust, both in other people and in themselves. “They feel that they’ve lost some part of themselves, that they’ll never be the person that they used to be,” she said. It can also have employment repercussions. “One of the outcomes of trauma is that you try to avoid everything that’s associated with the trauma,” Fitzgerald said. That can make it nearly impossible to want to get back in, say, the cab of a truck after being assaulted there. *** There are ways to mitigate sexual harassment and assault in trucking if companies are serious about eradicating it. Professionalizing the whole process would go a long way. Training programs, Wood argues, should fall under the purview of the education department and be subject to Title IX gender discrimination protections. On long trips with trainers or co-drivers, drivers should sleep in motels, and companies can create more routes that get drivers home faster. Workers need to know their rights and how to report violations of them. They need a safe and secure way to report incidents quickly after they happen – maybe panic buttons, or through regular, automatic check ins – and to trust that the companies will take them seriously and act without retaliating. “Those seem like simple things, but they can be really transformative,” said Jennifer Mondino, director of the TIME’S UP Legal Defense Fund, which offers low-income workers legal and media support in sexual harassment cases and has aided Zuniga’s case. Wood argues that people who harass or abuse their trainees or co-drivers should have their CDL licenses revoked or be banned from training or co-driving. She has also called for companies that are sued over sexual harassment and assault to be put on probation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and removed from the Department of Labor’s apprenticeship programs. In mid-March, Zuniga was hoping to get a new job driving trucks for a different company. “I just want to keep going forward,” she said. There are many days when she just wants to give up. But she knows she has to keep trying. “Because my daughters are watching.” • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

‘It’s happening now’: how rising sea levels are causing a US migration crisis,2022-04-07T10:00:10Z,Max Ufberg,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y5cy3,"Sea levels have risen about 9in since 1880, with one-third of that gain from the last 25 years alone. Every year, a flurry of reports are published warning of the risk to towns and cities along coastal areas. It’s one thing to hear about a looming disaster; it’s another to see the cataclysm play out in real time. That’s what’s happening in Taholah, a village on Washington’s coast that acts as the capital for the Quinault Indian Nation, a tribe of about 3,600 members. In Taholah, climate change-caused sea level rise has brought to the community a fast receding shoreline, and with it a heightened threat of flooding: according to Quinault estimates, the ocean level could increase by 2.6ft by 2100, pushing storm surges higher and bringing waves closer to town. On an overcast February morning, Larry Ralston, the 62-year-old treasurer of the Quinault Nation, drove his silver Ford SUV down a network of Taholah’s unmarked gravel roads, telling me about what this place used to look like, before climate change permanently reconfigured the landscape. Parked on a rock face overlooking the Pacific, he nodded toward a moss-covered boulder towering out of the water. As a kid in the 60s, Ralston said, he was able to trek by foot to the rock. And now? He reckons the water is 30ft deep. Back then the ocean didn’t seem like a menace – at least not an existential one. That’s no longer the case: some 660 Taholah residents who border the ocean now find themselves living in an increasingly dangerous flood zone. The only solution is for everyone – and everything – in the village to move uphill. “We can see firsthand what’s happening,” Ralston told me. “There’s no denying it.” *** Taholah signals what’s to come for coastal communities across the country. Already, about 15 million American homes are at risk of flooding, and the threat is only going to get worse. A report released in February by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) projected that sea level along the US coastline would rise by 10 to 12in, on average, in the next 30 years – an uptick that would make damaging flooding occur 10 times more often than it does today. “It’s important to understand in these communities that sea level rise is happening now,” said William Sweet, an oceanographer with Noaa’s National Ocean Service and the country’s top scientist studying sea level rise. “Its impacts are happening now, and those impacts will grow worse in the next 30 years. Minor-nuisance flooding will be replaced by flooding that’s more damaging to economies and to infrastructure.” That future could very well touch off a mass migration of people away from coastline and flood zones. Research published in 2020 in the journal PLOS One estimated that sea level rise could cause over 13 million Americans to relocate inland by 2100 – an outcome with huge economic, social and political consequences. Yet, even with the deluge of warnings, there is no centralized lifeline available to coastal communities. There are a number of federal programs designed to give assistance to such areas through government bodies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud), but those pots of money are far from adequate to tackle a problem of this scale. Some local governments have chosen to offer – and in a few cases mandate – buyouts to homeowners in vulnerable areas, who wind up dispersing. Others would prefer to keep the neighborhood intact – in Taholah’s case, by moving the whole village. In 2017, the Quinault Tribal Council adopted the Taholah Village Relocation Master Plan, which would move the lower enclave of the village about a half-mile uphill by 2030, where a new 200-acre development would offer flood-free land for over 300 housing units, a police station, a courthouse, a K-12 school and a museum, among other buildings. The initiative makes the Quinault among the first in the US – alongside communities in Louisiana and Alaska, among others – to voluntarily opt for a strategy of managed retreat away from impending climate threats. To date, the council has been able to build a new administrative complex, a so-called generations building to house Head Start and senior programs, and approximately 150 homes – construction that is owed to a combination of US Department of Agriculture grants, Hud money and the tribe’s own funds. To pay for the rest, Ralston estimates they’ll need an additional $200m – a daunting sum, especially considering the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was signed into law by Joe Biden last year provided just $130m to support relocation efforts for the 574 federally recognized tribes across the US. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there are roughly 5.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in the US, many of whom are on the frontlines of climate change. A multi-year study published last year in the journal Science found that Indigenous nations in the US not only lost 99% of their historical land, but what relatively little they were eventually allotted are often more exposed to climate change hazards than their historical lands. The Quinault Nation settled permanently on their 189,621-acre reservation – much of it conifer forest and unsuitable to farming – in the 19th century, after a long and at times contentious negotiation with the Washington government and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Though the allotted land was still a far cry from what was lost, the ocean provided a natural icebox for sockeye salmon (known as “blueback” among the Quinault peoples), a unique fish that is central to the Quinault identity, and is under threat due in part to ocean acidification and warmer waters. “There’s a parity between the Quinault people and the blueback,” Ralston said as his SUV ambled past a large illustrated cutout of the salmon affixed to a lamppost. “We try to save our blueback, so we can save ourselves.” ‘I wanted this community’ Two weeks later and 2,400-some miles away from Taholah, I was in the Allen Field subdivision of Houston, Texas, talking with Dolores Mendoza, a 35-year-old mother of three. She is trying to figure out how to convince people in the neighborhood – many of whom are relatives – that the county’s effort to remove them from their homes shouldn’t be ignored. Taholah and Harris county are a study in contrasts: the former, a cash-strapped program that, if successful, would keep a neighborhood intact; and the latter a messy but better-funded effort that will ultimately move people out of high-risk zones but tear a community apart. I met Mendoza, who works as a credit controller at an inspection agency, on a chilly afternoon at her former home, a three-bedroom house that’s just a stone’s throw from the Greens Bayou watershed. Harris county bought the place in December, paying Mendoza a total of $300,000 for the property ($70,000 for the house and $230,000 to relocate). The sale was a coup for her, given that she paid $62,000 to buy the 1,200sq ft house in 2010. She’s since moved to Kingwood, a wealthier neighborhood about 15 miles away. That’s not to say Mendoza was keen on leaving. She grew up in Allen Field, and, by her count, still has family living in 13 different nearby houses. “I wanted this community,” she said. “It’s not pretty to look at, but my family’s here.” It’s only a matter of time before that’s no longer the case. As we walked through the beige-colored house, which had been ransacked and vandalized in the two months since its sale, Mendoza recalled how the place used to look when she and her three kids lived there. “This was mine,” she said, gesturing toward a room that was empty except for the shards of glass littered on the floor. “I had my bed here. My makeup vanity here. My TV over here.” Harris county is a sprawling region of 4.7 million people, about half of whom live in Houston. Much like Taholah, it is caught in climate change’s crosshairs. Hurricanes are becoming more common in the area, bringing with them enough rainwater to flood the state’s bayou systems. Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston in 2017 and took the lives of at least 88 in Texas, was the third “500-year flood” within the last three years. Worse yet, the Texas coast has sunk about 2ft within the last century, due in part to excessive groundwater pumping, making the state more vulnerable to flooding. But Harris county also bears a different distinction: it is the national leader in federally funded home buyouts, responsible for some 2,500 acquisitions, on top of 1,000 homes purchased by the Harris county flood control district with local funds. Since the 1980s, Fema has supported over 43,000 property buyouts in the US. That is well short of the 3.63 million people in the country who are likely to encounter flooding every year. Until the last few years, buyouts in Harris county were all voluntary and favored affluent and white recipients, mirroring a national trend. In 2020, still reeling from Hurricane Harvey, the county secured funding through Fema and state agencies to introduce a new mandatory buyout program for around 400 mostly residential properties spread throughout eight areas. It’s estimated the mandatory program will affect about 2,000 people, about 13% of the local populace. In Allen Field, many of the homes that fall under the mandatory buyout guidelines are on Darjean Street, where Mendoza’s family still lives. Eligible homeowners in Allen Field – 86% of whom are non-white, according to census data – say the buyout process has been confusing and inefficient. Some residents were baffled when they first received a legalese-laden mailer explaining that they would have to sell their home to the government. Many in the area aren’t fluent in English, making the flyers even more confusing. “There’s a lot of red tape that makes it very difficult for families to figure out how to navigate the process,” said Shirley Ronquillo, a local community activist who has helped residents navigate buyout programs. Nor is it clear to many what their lives will look like when they move to a new neighborhood, which could be many miles away. According to a 2019 study published in the journal Social Problems, buyouts cause more significant erosion to the social fabric of communities with lower-value homes and Black and brown residents, in large part because they’re forced to move farther away to find affordable housing. (The community services department spokesperson said the program assigns to anyone in the buyout program a relocation specialist to “provide referrals to community resources and organizations to provide further assistance to residents”.) There’s also an issue of protraction. “It still takes Harris county over two years to close on the average property,” said Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. Some people, tired of waiting for the government, sell their homes to exploitative speculators, often for far less than they’d make in a buyout program. ‘Why are they being asked to leave?’ While Taholah is a better organized effort, it’s also, paradoxically, a less wellfunded one. “Unfortunately, the limited federal resources available are even less accessible to tribal communities,” said Washington representative Derek Kilmer, who worked to secure $500,000 for the Quinaults’ relocation efforts in the fiscal year 2022. Kilmer also sponsored the Tribal Coastal Resiliency Act, which would provide further support to Indigenous communities on coastal issues. Any additional funding would probably come through the housing, commerce or interior departments, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency – all of which are in the process of creating or revamping relocation programs. But getting money to a community as small as Taholah, where the median household income is about $32,000, can be a challenge. “Fema repeatedly told us that these competitive funds are based on numbers, not on need,” said Ralston, the Quinault treasurer. “Hurricane Katrina affected a quarter million people. Hurricane Taholah only affects 850 people. So, where are you going to put your money?” The Quinault Nation applied for two additional grants through Fema in 2020, totaling about $126,000,000. A Fema spokesperson wrote in an email that both applications were selected for review. “We anticipate the planning grant to be awarded soon.” *** Taholah’s lower village features rows of houses – many of them modest and worn – alongside a gym, a seafood wholesaler, a community center, a gas station-cum-deli, and a few other businesses. Many homes have boats scattered unceremoniously on their yards. There’s a 10ft seawall separating the town from the Pacific, though it’s been breached repeatedly in the last few years, despite repeated improvements by the army corps of engineers. “We used to get flooding in the lower village every three to five years,” Ralston said. Now it’s every year.” Ralston told me about his plans to commemorate the place they’ll leave behind. He imagines a park, well-maintained and accessible to the public, with fruit trees and picnic benches. “Just to memorialize the families that used to live here,” he said before letting out a quiet sigh. “Obviously that may not happen for a while. It’s just a vision.” In Allen Field, Mendoza says that the memory of Harvey – and the lack of government support in the wake of the hurricane – left a bad taste. Harvey hit low-income and non-white areas like Mendoza’s hardest, thanks to crumbling infrastructure and insufficient flood control measures. Ronquillo, the community activist, offered a more scathing critique: “You have a government entity coming in and saying, ‘you have to leave.’ Why are they being asked to leave? Because there was years of negligence, lack of support in our communities of color,” she said. “Harvey was terrifying,” Mendoza said. “I was here by myself with my kids. I didn’t even know how we were going to get out.” Help never came from the government; it was her brother-in-law, riding in on a hot-wired boat, who rescued Mendoza and her children. Mendoza waited for a year and half until the county could make good on its offer. She said she was told by the county not to spend money on repairs since she was going to be offloading the asset anyway. “They don’t want us to repair our houses, so we have leaking roofs, broken pipes, electrical problems.” (The community services department spokesperson said the county “encourages the homeowner to make repairs in the cases where by not making the repair a person’s health and safety are endangered”.) After leaving her house, Mendoza and I walked for a few minutes along the banks of Greens Bayou, where she reflected on her new life. The new house is great, she says. As is the kids’ school. But she still feels like a stranger. “I’ve seen my grandma twice since I moved,” she said. “Usually I’d see her every day, checking the mail when I’d go pick up the kids for school. Now we don’t have that community. I don’t know my neighbors.” At that moment a pair of adolescent boys ran by us, each one gripping a large ice cream shake. Mendoza knows the boys well; they’re close with her family. “It’s cold,” she said to them with a laugh. “Y’all should have your jackets on.”"
Homelands by Chitra Ramaswamy review – what it means to belong,2022-04-07T10:00:10Z,Aamna Mohdin,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y4nn7,"In the second half of James Baldwin’s seminal novel Giovanni’s Room, the narrator spots a sailor dressed all in white striding across a boulevard in Paris. He looks at him with a longing he doesn’t quite understand. The sailor reminds him of home, he realises, before making the following observation: “Perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.” Chitra Ramaswamy invokes Baldwin at the start of her new book, Homelands. In it, she explores how a place becomes a home, what makes a family put down roots, and how hatred can tear them out. She does so by deftly interweaving her own life story with that of the 97-year-old Holocaust survivor she befriends, Henry Wuga. They are, superficially, an unlikely pair: one born in 1970s Britain to Indian immigrant parents; the other a refugee from Nazi Germany who arrived on the Kindertransport in 1939. Ramaswamy, a journalist, first met Wuga in 2011, when her editor sent her to interview him and his wife in the run-up to Refugee Week. She found herself back again within a few weeks, this time on a social call – the first of many. Wuga, a keen skier, tells her of the time he met Prince Charles standing in a queue for a ski lift in the village of Klosters, Switzerland. When asked by the heir to the British throne where he came from, Henry, who has a German accent, answered “Glasgow”. He was pressed further, of course; Ramaswamy notes that the older she gets, the more she realises there is no answer to this question capable of satisfying everyone. Wuga’s bewildering journey takes him from Nuremberg, Germany, where he lived as a child, to Britain on the train that saved him – and 10,000 other Jewish children – from annihilation. “I remember the horror,” he tells Ramaswamy, “I was older, but many of these kids were six and seven years old. They had never left their mums and dads. I tell this story a lot. It never gets … it was the howling of the children. Carriages full of screaming children.” He arrived in Glasgow on 5 May 1939, where his sponsor was waiting for him, and bounced into his new existence in the way only children can. But his life changed once again at the outbreak of war. Shortly after turning 16, Wuga was found guilty of corresponding with the enemy, simply for writing to his parents and other family members in Europe. The account of his internment in six different camps is the most gripping part of Homelands, shedding light on a particularly dark period in the history of Britain’s treatment of refugees. It is a cliche to describe a book as achingly beautiful, but those are the words I reach for: Homelands is both beautiful and, at times, left me with an ache I struggled to name. Ramaswamy’s prose is at its most visceral when she writes of her grief at her mother’s death. At the hospital, the junior doctor and her mother speak in their native Kannada, and Ramaswamy sees her “magically transform” into her first self, her Indian self. “She seems not only to be dying but going home. And in every possible way I cannot follow her.”The narrative, which shifts between past and present, Ramaswamy and Wuga’s stories, sometimes feels stretched too thinly. It relies heavily on WG Sebald’s Austerlitz, the novel about a Kindertransport survivor who tries to recapture the truth of his shattered childhood. It is a haunting work, which Ramaswamy reads “obsessively” and turns to whenever she feels lost. But the references to it feel like an unnecessary distraction. The remarkably self-assured material that forms the backbone of the book is able to stand on its own. On the question of home and belonging, Ramaswamy finally comes to an answer that satisfies her, and the reader. “In the future I will start to understand that belonging lies in the search. That disorientation is the true birthplace of millions of us.” It is clear by the end that her search has also uncovered something more solid, since Ramaswamy and Wuga have found each other. • Homelands: The History of a Friendship is published by Canongate (£16.99).

‘You couldn’t get closer to spring if you tried’: readers’ favourite Easter day trips for families,2022-04-07T09:58:25Z,,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7egb,"Winning tip: Crabbing on the Thames estuary Have a free day out with the kids at Coalhouse Fort in East Tilbury in Essex. If you take bikes, start with a ride around the fort, then spend time in the playground, followed by a picnic on the green overlooking the fort (in the summer the ice-cream man is there, too). In the afternoon comes the best bit: crabbing! The fort has open days throughout the year (pay to enter), but the car park is free. There’s also a lovely family pub just before the fort, which does a great Sunday roast. Holly Saddington All beach bases covered, East Lothian Home to the famous bridge to nowhere, Belhaven Bay is an unspoilt beach popular for surfing and paddleboarding. Situated at the start of the John Muir Way walking trail, it is also a nature reserve, teeming with birdlife. Add an adventure playpark, picnic spots and toilets, and there’s everything you could possibly need. And it’s all free, bar a £2.50 all-day parking charge. Paul Gillon A slice of the Med in Devon Salcombe North Sands in Devon is a beautiful cove with great rock pools and a sandy beach – and lots of pretty shells to adorn sandcastles. For a bite to eat, head to The Winking Prawn right near the beach. On a hot summer’s day, it’s just like being in the Med, but even on a blustery spring day it’s fun. Sharon Robin Hood’s Cave, Peak District Craggy Stanage Edge is a natural parkour course offering unlimited adventure along the escarpment. Clamber down to Robin Hood’s Cave, hidden away in the cliff face, for the perfect side trip, and bring it to life with folklore tales of Robin of Loxley and Little John from nearby Hathersage. Lindsay Allen Lamb birthing in Sussex Perched on the sloping chalk shoulders of the South Downs above Shoreham lies the authentic working Coombes Farm (£5 adults, £4 children), which opens its doors every spring. Picnic among the daffodils while sun reflects off the channel and walk freely through the lambing sheds – if the timing’s right, children can marvel at a live birth. For £4 each, take a tractor ride over the Downs for crystal-clear views of the national park and sea. My one-year-old shook with excitement with every gear change. You couldn’t get closer to spring if you tried. Oliver Holbrook Tram rides and ferris wheels in Llandudno The Victorian town of Llandudno offers one of my favourite days out. Escape the crowds by taking the tram up the Great Orme, then hike around the nature trail to be rewarded with beautiful heather and butterflies, and gorgeous views of Anglesey and the Isle of Man. After, take the tram, or cable car, back down and have an ice-cream on the pier while watching Punch and Judy slog it out. There’s also a giant ferris wheel that lights up at night. For food, head to the Cottage Loaf in Llandudno, or the Queens Head in nearby Glanwydden. Bethan Patfield Gloucestershire’s magical woodland With moss- and lichen-coated trees and rocks, winding pathways and fairytale bridges, it’s no puzzle why Puzzlewood (adult £8.50, child £7) has been used as a location for film and TV shows including Doctor Who, Merlin and Star Wars. A trip to this otherworldly wood in the Forest of Dean, Coleford, is perfect for triggering imaginations of any age. There’s also a cafe, a willow maze and farm animals.

Refuel with Yorkshire ice-cream in the gardens or visit Betty’s tea rooms. Debbie Rolls Orange rolling, Bedfordshire Though the tradition came to an end some years ago, my favourite family Easter outing combined British eccentricity with religious roots. We would go to Dunstable’s Pascombe Pit to enjoy the Good Friday Orange Rolling, when locals and tourists gathered at the top of the hill, rolled oranges down the slopes and tried to catch them. The oranges represented the rolling away of the stone of Christ’s tomb and anyone who caught one would have a long – or even a second – life, according to folklore. Oranges replaced the more symbolic eggs as they didn’t break and could still be eaten after their downward journey. Greta"
Manchester United’s fans’ share scheme in deadlock a year after being proposed ,2022-04-07T09:49:29Z,Exclusive by Jamie Jackson,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nqf,"Manchester United’s proposed fan share scheme is at a critical juncture with no guarantee it will go ahead. The United co-chairman Joel Glazer announced the move last May after supporter protests – a group of about 100 broke into Old Trafford causing the Premier Leaguer fixture with Liverpool to be postponed – about the Glazer family’s ownership of the club. The protests were ignited by United’s decision to join the short-lived European Super League in April. Glazer hoped the prospect of fans owning shares in the club would be in place for the start of this season but, as the first anniversary of the Super League’s collapse approaches, it remains, at best, a work in progress. “We have worked hard since last summer to design a fans’ share scheme which would open a path for fans to build a meaningful ownership stake in the club,” a United spokesperson said. “Significant progress has been made, but this is a complex project and we are continuing to work towards a robust and attractive proposal for fans.” United are in negotiations with the Manchester United Supporters’ Trust regarding a further round of demands and counter-proposals from the body after agreement was reached on an initial tranche of shares. Discussions have entered a final, sensitive stage after extensive consultation with legal and financial advisers. Must’s position is that United’s offer is not acceptable while the club’s stance is that they are working through the final demands of the trust. It is understood one of the trust’s issues relates to a technicality regarding the Glazers’ share-voting power. As part of the process, Glazer is in discussion with his five siblings – Avram, Darcie, Kevin, Bryan and Edward. All of them have to sign off on a final agreement. If the fan share scheme does go ahead, the new shares issued would be part of a “B” category, meaning they would match those owned by the Glazers and have 10 times the voting weight of “A” category, which are owned by most investors."
First Thing: Zelenskiy says Russia will see new sanctions as ‘permission to attack’,2022-04-07T09:48:56Z,Jem Bartholomew,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nch,"Hello and good morning, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said yesterday that new sanctions by the west against Russia did not go far enough and would be seen by invading forces as a “permission to attack”, as fears of an assault on the east of the country intensify. Zelenskiy’s comments come after the US, UK and EU unveiled a raft of new sanctions targeting Russian banks and the country’s elites. The US measures include a ban on investing in Russia as well as sanctions on president Vladimir Putin’s adult daughters. The EU sanctions include a ban on coal imports and restrictions on banks. “This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. “If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons … it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to attack.” What sanctions does Zelenskiy want? He called for the west to reject Russian oil and completely block the country’s banks from the international finance system. What’s the latest on a potential Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine? The Kremlin has said it intends to seize the entire self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, with Putin reportedly keen to declare victory by 9 May, the annual second world war commemoration. How is Ukraine responding to the fresh offensive threat? Ukraine urged civilians to leave the east of the country while they still could. Meanwhile, the Pentagon said a “small number” of Ukrainian soldiers were being trained in the US to operate Switchblade drones. What is the international community doing? The UN general assembly will vote today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN premier human rights body after discoveries of potential Russian war crimes. Nato foreign ministers also meet today in Brussels for talks on providing support to bring an end to the war. Meanwhile, the Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, offered some optimism about the Ukraine resistance. “Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine,” he said. Trump advisers Navarro and Scavino in contempt of Congress for ignoring subpoenas, House votes The House voted yesterday to hold two of Donald Trump’s top advisers – Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino – in criminal contempt of Congress. That’s because of their months-long refusal to comply with subpoenas issued by the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack. The approval of the contempt resolution, by a vote of 220 to 203, sets the two Trump aides on the path toward criminal prosecution by the justice department as the panel escalates its inquiry into whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. Congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the select committee who introduced the contempt resolution to the House floor, said the select committee needed the House to advance the measure in order to reaffirm the consequences for defying the January 6 investigation. What punishment could the advisers face if convicted? Up to a year in federal prison, $100,000 in fines – or both. Why won’t Navarro and Scavino testify? It means the select committee can’t extract information from them about Trump’s unlawful scheme to have then vice-president Mike Pence stop the election certification. What happens next?

MyPillow chief sued for defamation by former Dominion Voting employee The chief executive of the bedding company MyPillow, Mike Lindell, has been sued for defamation by a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems. Eric Coomer, the former employee of the voting machines company that became embroiled in Donald Trump’s false claims that he was denied victory at the 2020 election because of widespread voter fraud, has filed a court complaint against Lindell. The suit alleges that Lindell, and his media platform Frankspeech, targeted Coomer as part of his “efforts to undermine faith in American democracy and enrich himself in the process”. Who is the MyPillow boss? Mike Lindell is a Trump supporter, conservative activist and conspiracy theorist who supported baseless claims the 2020 election was rigged. What did Lindell say about the lawsuit? “MyPillow and Frankspeech didn’t do nothing,” he said in a statement after being handed the lawsuit at a rally in Denver, Colorado. “They’re trying to cancel Frankspeech, your favorite show!” In other news … North Korea could hold a nuclear weapon test next week, a senior US official warned.

Mdou Moctar review – passionate shredding by Nigerien guitar hero,2022-04-07T09:47:08Z,Caroline Sullivan,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nnn,"‘Fuck this world music, this racist term. This is a rock band,” Mikey Coltun told Wire magazine in February. Coltun, bassist in Mdou Moctar’s backing trio, was right. Anyone inclined to take Nigerien guitarist Moctar or his band at face value will be disabused of the “world music” notion as soon as they start to play. In calf-length Tuareg robes and turban-like white tagelmusts, they passionately shred and lock into psychedelic grooves. Singing in the Tuareg language Tamasheq, Moctar rewrites the guitar-hero rulebook: lesson one is that surging guitar music marinated in the African/American folk fusion known as desert blues is rock. Ostensibly here to promote the resoundingly praised current album, Afrique Victime, Moctar – “the Hendrix of the Sahara”, as he’s been tagged – is the type who needs no excuse to unpack his white left-handed Stratocaster and play. In an inversion of the usual rock star entrance, the 38-year-old even arrives on stage before his band, who amble on a few minutes later. The four are quickly immersed in the 2017 track Amidini, which proceeds from delicately finger-picked opening bars to psych-drone. Next, Kamane Tarhanin explains the many comparisons to Eddie Van Halen. New Yorker Coltun, the lone American in the group, has said that moshpits and crowd-surfing often break out at their shows, and we find out why: when Moctar slides into a melodic pattern and the others fall in step with him, creating layer on thrusting layer of noise at stunning speed, the urge to hurl yourself at another person arises. Packed in shoulder-to-shoulder, tonight’s crowd have to make do with vigorous body-shaking. Moctar, who doesn’t interrupt the flow by speaking to the audience, is a striking figure. A head taller than Coltun, rhythm guitarist Ahmoudou Madassane and a drummer, Souleymane Ibrahim, who redefines the word “powerhouse”, Moctar nods along to the beat while otherwise remaining impassive. Not even the political urgency of the show-closing song, Afrique Victime, which excoriates former colonial ruler France for leaving Niger impoverished, induces a change of expression. Moctar just lets his thrilling music do the talking. • At Hare and Hounds, Birmingham, 7 April. Then touring."
Section 44 strikes again: Labor candidate for Hughes quits race due to Greek citizenship concerns,2022-04-07T09:45:22Z,Anne Davies,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nga,"Labor’s candidate for the hotly contested federal seat of Hughes in Sydney has withdrawn over section 44 citizenship concerns, leaving the ALP scrambling to find a replacement just days before the election is likely to be called. Peter Tsambalas, a local teacher, was preselected unopposed by ALP branch members in January. But he had not been officially endorsed as he was waiting for notification from Greek authorities that he had officially renounced his Greek citizenship. He began the process in December 2021. Despite being born in Australia and having Australian citizenship, Tsambalas acquired dual citizenship via his migrant parents. This is sufficient to trigger section 44 of the constitution which says a person is ineligible to run for federal parliament if they are “under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power”. “My team and I put every effort into resolving the citizenship question but it is clear we will not get there in time,” Tsambalas said on Thursday. “I want to thank all those who have supported me to this point. We spent several months working hard on the campaign and I believe I would have taken the fight up well in Hughes. “However, I now look forward to giving whatever assistance I can to the successful Labor candidate in this important election.” The seat of Hughes in Sydney’s south is currently held by former Liberal Craig Kelly with a 9.3% margin. Kelly resigned from the Liberal party over controversial views on Covid-19 and vaccination. Usually, Hughes would be a safe seat for the Liberals, but Kelly’s decision to run for the United Australia party, combined with the turmoil among the Liberals over preselections, has made it highly unpredictable. There are also two community independent candidates running – Georgia Steele and Linda Seymour. Both sides of politics acknowledge that section 44 poses a significant impediment for candidates who come from a multicultural background. It often requires careful analysis of citizen laws of another country and applications to foreign governments to renounce any rights to citizenship. However, changing section 44 would require a referendum and no steps have yet been taken to achieve that change. In Wentworth, the independent candidate Allegra Spender has had to give up her Italian citizenship acquired via her late mother – the fashion designer Carla Zampatti. She has publicly lamented it is one of the sacrifices she has had to make to run for parliament. A spokesperson for her campaign confirmed she was no longer an Italian citizen. Tsambalas is the first casualty of section 44 in this election campaign but may not be the last. On Saturday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced nine candidates he had handpicked to run in seats in the May election. Many are from multicultural backgrounds. A spokesperson for the NSW Liberals said the process was well underway to ensure their eligibility. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Section 44 triggered an eligibility crisis in federal parliament in 2017. Six senators and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, were referred to the high court between August and September that year. In October 2017, the high court ruled that five were ineligible to be elected being dual citizens at the time of nomination. In November 2017, three more senators resigned after recognising their dual citizenship. Joyce and John Alexander returned to the lower house after rectifying their citizenship status and winning byelections. The high court ruled that a candidate must take reasonable steps to renounce any dual citizenship."
Kidd Creole: hip-hop pioneer found guilty of first-degree manslaughter,2022-04-07T09:25:50Z,Laura Snapes,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nj7,"Hip-hop pioneer Kidd Creole has been found guilty of first-degree manslaughter for stabbing a homeless man in 2017. The musician, real name Nathaniel Glover, 62, was an original member of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five alongside his brother Melle Mel, AKA Melvin Glover. (He is not associated with Kid Creole and the Coconuts, the band led by August Darnell.) On 1 August 2017, he had a run-in with a 55-year-old homeless man named John Jolly, whom he believed was attempting to solicit him for sex. Glover stabbed Jolly, who later died in hospital. When he was arrested the day after the assault on a charge of second-degree murder, Glover admitted to the attack during a videotaped police interview, although he was unaware at the time of Jolly’s death. “To tell the truth, I thought he was gay and because I thought he was gay, and he was saying that to me, ‘what’s up,’ I was thinking that he was thinking I was gay,” Glover told police. “So I was a little annoyed by that. “He approached me. I got a little nervous. So then I tried to back up a little bit, and he moved forward, and then I just took the knife and stabbed him … I wish I never would have seen him. It’s all my fault, because I chose to stab him. I have to take responsibility for that.” Prosecutors alleged that Glover’s motives were homophobic. His lawyers said he stabbed Jolly out of fear and argued that Jolly’s medical records did not support the allegation that he had died of a stab wound, and claimed that a combination of alcohol and hospital-administered sedatives had in fact contributed to Jolly’s death. A Manhattan jury came to the guilty verdict within hours of lawyers on both sides presenting their closing arguments, Rolling Stone reports. Glover will be sentenced on 4 May and faces a maximum of 25 years in prison. He had previously been working as a handyman and security guard in Manhattan."
Thieving sea lions break into salmon farm and gorge on feast of fish,2022-04-07T09:10:09Z,Leyland Cecco,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7kaq,"Dozens of thieving sea lions in western Canada have spent the last few weeks gorging on fish after brazenly slipping into an industrial salmon farm – and ignoring all attempts to make them move on. Cermaq, the aquaculture giant with operations in Norway, Chile and Canada, says the wily predators were able to evade netting and electric fences in late March as part of a “breach event” at the Rant Point farm near Tofino in British Columbia. Local conservation groups, who oppose the fish farms and only learned of the breach on Sunday, have warned the sea lions themselves are in danger the longer they spend inside the farm. “We witnessed the sea lion going over one of the fences jumping right into a ‘bird net’, which is suspended net above the pens. He struggled for quite some time to free himself,” said Bonny Glambeck of Clayoquot Action, a local environmental group. “There’s a lot of ropes and hoses around, so we’re increasingly concerned about entanglement.” In little more than a decade, more than 100 sea lions have drowned after getting tangled in fish farm nets, as has one humpback whale, highlighting the dangers the farms and their nets pose to local wildlife. Efforts to scare the sea lions away, including with loud noises, have so far failed. The company said exits are available to the intruders “should they choose to leave”– an offer the sea lions appear to have declined. In 2016, after sea lions breached another Cermaq fish farm, Canada’s department of fisheries and oceans authorized the company to shoot the animals. The DFO says there is a “strict requirement” that none of the sea lions be killed. Sea lions, a common mammal in the waters off Vancouver Island, typically hunt in groups and feast on herring, salmon, rock fish and even small sharks. But the pinnipeds hit paydirt when they made their way into pens full of salmon. The farm can hold as many as 500,000 Atlantic salmon, although the company had already started the weeks-long process of harvesting in March when the first sea lions arrived. More sea lions have since joined in the heist, much to the frustration of the company, which says it hopes to finish harvesting by the third week of April. The breach at the farm has also drawn attention to the British Columbia fish farms, a number of which have been ordered to close by the federal government by 2025 amid environmental concerns and opposition from Indigenous nations. Companies in the region, including Cermaq, have fought the order and say thousands of jobs will be lost. Glambeck worries the sea lions will become habituated to humans and once the salmon are gone, turn to the 14 other farms in the area. “They’re very intelligent animals and it’s so disheartening and heartbreaking to see these animals being potentially harmed by this industry,” she said."
‘Doubly erased’: artwork recording names of domestic violence victims removed from Melbourne museum,2022-04-07T09:12:43Z,Kelly Burke,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ndm,"An artwork recognising almost 1,000 women and children killed by men in Australia has been removed from a Melbourne museum, partly on the grounds it could traumatise some visitors. Melbourne artist Dans Bain was asked on Wednesday to remove her 30 metre work, The Lost Petition, from the Her Place Women’s Museum before Friday’s opening of an exhibition celebrating 25 years of women in politics, curated by the Australian Labor party-affiliated network Emily’s List. According to a statement issued by the chair of the Her Place Women’s Museum board, Mary Delahunty, The Lost Petition was taken down because of the work’s size and scale, and the lack of an alternative space to install it in the east Melbourne museum. But Emily’s List national co-convenor Leigh Svendsen confirmed to the Guardian the organisation had asked the museum’s board to have the artwork removed, partly out of concern that there were insufficient measures in place for people who might be triggered by the work’s confronting nature. “It’s a fantastic exhibit, but we only have volunteers to staff the Her Story exhibition, we certainly haven’t any capacity or ability to support people if they become upset by Dans’ work,” Svendsen said. “I’m not suggesting that that would necessarily happen [but] I think that’s something that needs to be taken into consideration.” The Lost Petition fabric artwork consists of 12 white bedsheets stitched together and bears the names of 986 women and children murdered through domestic violence since 2008. As more deaths occur, their names are added to the work. The artist said the Emily’s List request to remove her work was like a “double erasure” of the women and children who had already had their lives snatched away. “I’ve had families contact me and asked for photos – I had learned just recently, a family from New Zealand, their mother is on the list, and the family asked me to take photos,” Bain told the Guardian. “I had to say, unfortunately, we’ve had to remove it from public viewing. And it just feels awful that we’re doing that to families. “This work is about bringing visibility to this issue of male violence against women and children and I’m pretty devastated that these lives have now been doubly erased because it’s been decided The Lost Petition is an uncomfortable reality.” The names of the victims inscribed on the artwork are provided by the founder of the anti-gendered violence group the Red Heart Campaign, Sherele Moody, who said the work’s removal was an “uncaring slap in the face” for the families of every victim named on the artwork. “I know some people hate this artwork because it tells an uncomfortable truth about violence in Australia,” she said. “But to see a museum for women and another high profile women’s organisation deem it inappropriate is massive kick in the guts for me and for Dans. “Saying now is not the time to hang this project shows how dead women and kids are an inconvenience to even those who should know better.” Delahunty’s statement issued on Thursday said the museum board had made the decision to reinstall the artwork later in the year, in agreement with the artist. “We are planning to welcome The Lost Petition back to Her Place Museum later in the year as a focus of the Her Voice program of Australian Women’s activism, after May when The Lost Petition will tour regionally,” she said. “It is a powerful artwork and that power is reflected in the feedback we have received.”"
Kenya’s already fragile elections now face a dangerous new enemy: big tech platforms,2022-04-07T09:00:09Z,Odanga Madung,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y63eg,"This August, tens of millions of Africans will turn their attention to Kenya’s general election. Kenya’s recent history features hotly contested, sometimes violent elections in which candidates and their allies have used tribal politics to turn people against one another. Yet as this election approaches, one of the biggest dangers comes much further from home: US and Chinese tech platforms. Before unpacking the dangerous role that tech platforms are playing in Kenya, it’s important to understand the high stakes. For many Kenyans, this is the mother of all elections. The country’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta of the Jubilee party, has overseen an economy battered by inflation and debt, bruised by corruption and struggling to get on its feet due to the harm inflicted by Covid. Fighting to be the next president are Kenyatta’s deputy, William Ruto, and the leader of the opposition, Raila Odinga, of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). The last time Kenyatta and Ruto were on opposing sides of an election, in 2007 and 2008, the country was plagued by violence, and they ended up on trial in the international criminal court (ICC). (Kenyatta’s charges were dropped in December 2014, and the court terminated Ruto’s case due to weak evidence.) Essential discussions about the election are unfolding on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok. It’s on these platforms that crucial civic information – but also disinformation and hate speech – will be amplified. Meanwhile, Kenya receives just a fraction of the resources – if that – that platforms give to address similar issues in western elections. They have acquired a massive civic responsibility in our countries – one that they are having trouble accepting. These platforms already have an unpleasant history of abetting election disinformation across Kenya. In 2013 and 2017, Kenyatta’s campaigns used Cambridge Analytica to create election branding and messaging that critics called “divisive propaganda” that inflamed ethnic tensions. Similarly, Google ran poisonous attack ads under the banner “The Real Raila” on its search and YouTube products from Harris Media – a Texas-based rightwing media company that was also hired by Trump during his 2016 campaigns. Now it’s happening all over again. In the past few months, work I published with Mozilla reported how Twitter’s complacency has allowed for the development of a thriving disinformation industry in Kenya, comprised of influencers-for-hire who sell their services on the platform to politicians and political groups. This industry has repeatedly been used by various problematic actors to consolidate power and neutralise public outcry, from lawmakers (or their proxies) to political groups abroad. For example, in 2021 Kenyan judges and activists underwent wave after wave of attacks on Twitter as Kenyatta and Odinga sought to get their elite pact, titled Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), past the courts. Further investigations found that the same shady industry attempted to neutralise public outcry after Kenyatta was implicated in Africa Uncensored’s Pandora Papers revelations (along with other news organisations worldwide) in late 2021. (Kenyatta said the papers “would go a long way in enhancing financial transparency required in Kenya”, but never responded to his presence in the documents.) It doesn’t stop there. Rightwing political organisations in places such as Spain have been using platforms to meddle with Kenyans’ civic debate online. The Spanish organisation CitizenGO ran campaigns over the past few years that Twitter amplified through its trending algorithm to millions of Kenyans in an attempt to oust politicians who support progressive legislation. Meanwhile, allegations about Facebook’s moderation efforts in Africa dim any optimism that big tech companies might learn from past failures. Time recently reported on the alleged poor pay and working conditions of Facebook’s content moderators in Kenya. Moderators claimed that speed was prioritised over all else, including health. There are many criticisms that Facebook content moderators around the world are treated poorly, but the low pay and poor conditions in Africa are especially stark. African moderators accused Meta and Sama (Meta’s moderation subcontractor) of discrimination and rights abuses after the working conditions left many of them with PTSD. Since the revelations came to light Meta and Sama have been served with legal letters for breaking multiple sections of Kenya’s labour laws. Such a situation means that hate speech and incitement will continue to run rampant on the platform. Disinformation has been allowed to fester in east Africa, especially when compared to regions like North America and western Europe. This is evidence of two larger problems. The first is US tech platforms’ context bias in Africa. US platforms and the people who run them – most of whom are based in California – simply don’t know the histories and norms of African democracy. Secondly, platform moderation and policies guiding AI regulation are enabling colonial interference, culturally and politically in digital spaces. As the Kenyan researcher and political analyst Nanjala Nyabola asks in reference to Cambridge Analytica’s hand in the Kenyan election: “What does accountability for political misinformation look like when a British company uses an American platform to influence political discourse in a Kenyan election?” There are few incentives for platforms to address these problems. Big tech’s choices are consistently driven by public perception, business risk, the threat of regulation and the spectacle of PR fires. That’s why platforms are quick to scrub QAnon content in the US or meet GDPR regulations in the EU, but don’t show the same attention when dealing with health disinformation in Kenya, or adhering to the country’s incitement laws. The policies and values of these platforms have normalised a kind of deviance – one that enables a dismissal of regions and populations that fall in its “rest of the world” category. As the election draws nearer, many platforms are still unwilling to publicly commit to a roadmap that outlines how they are going to fight misinformation and disinformation in Kenya and Africa more broadly. We need platforms to inform Kenyan users about how they will use algorithms to spot hate speech and election-related disinformation; how they will foster relationships with civil society to factcheck content in English, Kiswahili and Sheng; and finally, how they’ll help Kenyans get accurate information about where to vote. Election disinformation is not a problem that platforms can fix on their own. However, they have an outsized responsibility to protect Kenyan civil society and our democratic discourse.

MLB 2022 predictions: Is the championship heading to Canada this year?,2022-04-07T09:00:09Z,"David Lengel, Hunter Felt and Bryan Armen Graham",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7k5b,"One bold prediction … MLB will announce a new rule for next season which will allow managers a limited number of infield shifts a game. So it becomes a strategy of when to seek the defensive advantage. Should managers wait until the ninth inning? Keep their infield moves for certain players? Sounds like fun to me! DL The New York Yankees somehow win 100 games. It’s been fun mocking the organization’s uncharacteristic lack of spending this offseason, particularly as the rest of the AL East has gotten tougher. But history tells us that the Yankees have an annoying knack of going on a tear right when everybody counts them out. HF The Detroit Tigers, five years removed from their last winning campaign and three since losing a mind-numbing 114 games, will contend for a playoff spot until the final week of the regular season. BAG I’m most looking forward to … Actual baseball, for 162 games, with fans in the seats. Between the pandemic and the work stoppage that I believed would kill the entire 2022 season, this campaign is as welcome as they come. DL No longer wasting precious minutes of my life watching pitchers hit in the National League. With the newly adopted universal DH, baseball has finally fully entered the modern world. It’s a rare win for common sense in 2022’s America, although I will admit it was cool when Bartolo Colon hit a home run that one time. HF The pandemic gave baseball commissioner Rob Manfred the perfect cover to enact a handful of experimental rules designed to cut down on overlong games and limit physical contact. Predictably (and tragically), the universal designated hitter is here to stay. But I was pleasantly surprised to see two of the others won’t be back for 2022: 1) seven-inning doubleheaders and 2) the extra-innings rule starting each half-inning after the ninth with a runner on second base. BAG Your MVPs will be … If Shohei Ohtani is healthy, hits and pitches, how is anyone else going to win the AL MVP award? And now that he’s allowed to hit in games after being removed as a hurler, he’ll have even more at-bats. There is a bit more competition in the NL however, where the majestic Juan Soto should get the award he deserved to win last year. DL Let’s go all chalk here. I’m just going to be Mr Predictable and pick Mr Predictable in the AL with the Los Angeles Angels’ Mike Trout. In the NL, we’ll go with the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Mookie Betts. It’s unlikely that both will win, but it’s pretty good odds that at least one of these bets will pay off, barring injuries. HF Toronto’s Vladimir Guerrero Jr may be the best hitter in the game today. But it seems the AL award until further notice belongs to Ohtani, the two-way Japanese star with a once-in-a-century skillset. In the National League, it’s Washington outfielder Soto. BAG Cy Young winners … Carlos Rodon is making a move to a bigger park in San Francisco which will help the former White Sox hurler move into Cy Young territory but Zack Wheeler, totally robbed of the award in 2021 will get it this time around. The AL race is probably the most open in years, especially with all the question marks hanging around Gerrit Cole. Robbie Ray certainly has a chance to repeat in his new roomy confines in Seattle. DL The Atlanta Braves’ Max Fried hasn’t yet hit his ceiling and this award certainly feels within his grasp, even if some other NL pitchers have more name recognition. Keeping up with the Yankees theme, let’s go with their ace Cole in the AL, especially assuming that older voters are still infatuated with the concept of pitching wins. HF The National League race opened up with last week’s news that Mets ace Jacob deGrom will miss significant time due to a shoulder injury. Look for Dodgers righty Walker Buehler to make the most of his absence. In the American League, it’s Yankees star Cole’s trophy to lose. BAG AL East Good lord the Jays can rake, with a lineup looking like a modern day murderers row. They lost Ray from their rotation, but gained Kevin Gausman, so it’s all there for a Toronto team bracing for a full season of home games for the first time since 2019. That said, it’s probably the toughest division in baseball, and it should be a war to the finish, where the Jays pip the Rays on the last day of the season. DL New York Yankees. The AL East is going to be brutal this year, to the point where literally all the AL wildcards could emerge from the division. The only predictable thing might be that the Baltimore Orioles are going to be one of the worst teams in baseball, everything else might come down to the last week. HF Toronto Blue Jays. Don’t be surprised if the smart-spending Tampa Bay Rays figure out a way to come out on top again, but it’s simply too hard to pick against this Blue Jays lineup in a stacked division that will end up sending four teams to the postseason. BAG AL Central Tony La Russa may annoy his fanbase, but nothing will stop the White Sox from repeating as AL Central champs. Think of it as a 162 game playoff tune-up for the Pale Hose, where an early-round ouster may not be as inevitable as most would think. They’re extremely talented, and if they invest at the trade deadline, they will compete for a “piece of metal” in October. DL Chicago White Sox. Their fate would certainly look sunnier if not for Lance Lynn’s knee injury, but this is a White Sox team that won 93 games last season and they have a highly potent offense. HF Chicago White Sox. The South Siders are once again the most complete team in the American League’s weakest division, although they’ll weather a more spirited challenge from the improved Twins. BAG AL West Seattle were by far the luckiest team in baseball last season, competing for a wildcard game berth until late in the season. But even if lightning strikes twice, the Astros are still poised to win the division for the fifth time in six seasons. The biggest question is whether the Angels, with Mike Trout and Ohtani, will finally reach the postseason, something neutral baseball fans should be pining for. DL It still blows my mind that the Houston Astros have overtaken the Yankees as the biggest heels in baseball. It’s close to impossible to root for this particular ownership, but it’s hard not to hope for the best for veteran manager Dusty Baker and 39-year-old ace Justin Verlander. HF Houston Astros. The Mariners were already knocking on the door even before adding Cy Young award winner Ray to the rotation. But the reigning American League pennant winners remain the class of this division, even without Carlos Correa. BAG NL East The Freddie Freeman-less Braves shouldn’t suffer thanks to the aggressive acquisition of Matt Olson. And the champs also boosted the back of their bullpen with Kenley Jansen and Collin McHugh, so they shouldn’t have too much trouble in their bid to repeat. DL If the New York Mets had some health breaks, they could be a potential candidate here but there is no conceivable dimension where the Mets will ever remain healthy (Jacob deGrom has already been put on ice and Max Scherzer remains an early question mark). I’m going to hand this division over to instead to the Atlanta Braves. HF Philadelphia Phillies. Bryce Harper’s MVP campaign was weighed down by a Philly bullpen whose 34 blown saves equaled the 2004 Colorado Rockies’ major-league record (although the Nationals’ 35 pipped them both). Enter Corey Knebel, the 30-year-old closer who bet on himself by signing a one-year, $10m contract. The improved bullpen and offseason additions of Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos will see the Phillies end their decade-long postseason drought. BAG NL Central The Brewers are a ton of fun with a deep pitching rotation combined with an electric bullpen and a more than satisfactory lineup. The only club that can compete with Milwaukee are the Cardinals, and their rotation takes a hit with Jack Flaherty’s injury issues. It’s cakewalk territory for the Brew Crew. DL This St Louis Cardinals team is so old that the most famous player on the lineup was retired until a few weeks ago. While Albert Pujols won’t likely be much of a factor in the division, Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright can still take this team into the playoffs. I’d call them sentimental favorites among the baseball graybeards. HF Milwaukee Brewers. A stout rotation including reigning Cy Young award winner Corbin Burnes, Brandon Woodruff, Freddy Peralta, Adrian Houser and Eric Lauer will see the Brewers repeat as champions of MLB’s weakest division. BAG NL West Expect the Dodgers to take back the NL West after the surprising Giants take a small step back. LA are loaded once again, adding Freeman, while their looming lineup question is whether or not Cody Bellinger will recover from a dismal 2021. Sadly, the Padres’ long-term loss of Fernando Tatis Jr takes a bit of the zetz out of this would-be stacked division. DL The Los Angeles Dodgers’ biggest issue just might be manager Dave Roberts’s ongoing habit of making life more difficult for himself. This time around, Roberts went out of his way to guarantee a title, something which hasn’t paid off since New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath pulled off the trick in the NFL. HF LA Dodgers. Baseball’s biggest spenders offset the departures of Corey Seager and Max Scherzer by adding Freeman. That allows Dave Roberts to deploy a lineup with MVP winners in right field (Betts), center field (Bellinger) and first base (Freeman) and a glut of former All-Stars in between (Trea Turner, Max Muncy, Justin Turner, Will Smith, Chris Taylor). BAG AL wildcard teams … Rays, Red Sox, Angels. DL Blue Jays, Rays, Red Sox. HF Yankees, Rays, Red Sox. BAG NL wildcard teams Padres, Mets, Giants. DL Brewers, Giants, Padres. HF Braves, Giants, Padres. BAG ALCS Blue Jays 4-3 Rays. DL Yankees 4-2 White Sox. HF White Sox 4-3 Blue Jays. BAG NLCS Dodgers 4-3 Braves. DL Dodgers 4-2 Braves. HF Dodgers 4-1 Braves. BAG World Series Blue Jays 4-2 Dodgers. The Blue Jays have one of the most compelling lineups in MLB, and if they all click, it could be a generational group that brings a title to Canada for the first time since 1993. A dynamic, young and colorful roster led by Vladimir Guerrero only needs pitching help and based on the way aggressive ownership has collected talent over the past few seasons, there’s no reason to believe team president Mark Shapiro won’t bring in any missing pieces at the trade deadline. The Rogers Center is the loudest venue in baseball, and it will explode in October with a win over Los Angeles in the World Series. DL Dodgers 4-1 Yankees. Did you know that the Yankees and Dodgers both used to play in New York and had an intense rivalry? Get ready to hear about it, again and again, should this World Series matchup come to fruition. Unfortunately, the series might not last long enough for the broadcasters to give us the complete history because the Dodgers once again will have the most complete lineup in the major leagues, plus Walker Buehler and Clayton Kershaw ready to pitch twice in a seven-game series. HF Dodgers 4-2 White Sox. The deep-pocketed, talent-stacked LA Dodgers were favorites even before the Freeman signing that won the offseason. It’s simply baffling they only have a single Covid title to show for their decade-plus of dominance, speaking to the crapshoot of a playoff format where, for better or worse, the best team doesn’t always come out on top. In a game with no sure things, the Dodgers are the closest thing to one. BAG"
Going full meta: Nicolas Cage and the actors who love playing themselves ,2022-04-07T09:00:09Z,Ann Lee,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ajd,"Acting is all about immersing yourself in a character, embracing someone else’s reality and leaving yourself behind in the process. That is, unless you go for the ultimate role: yourself. For those who have been unable to resist the allure of the familiar, appearing as a heightened version of themselves in a film can lead to one of the most intriguing performances of their career. Nicolas Cage is the latest actor to put his on- and off-screen persona under the white-hot glare of the Hollywood microscope in The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, a bracingly original meta-comedy. Not only is he playing himself – albeit a more cash-strapped version facing financial ruin – he also stars as his imaginary alter ego: Nicky (a Wild At Heart-era Cage who has been eerily de-aged with CGI). In recent years, on screen and off, Cage has garnered a reputation for eccentricity, to put it mildly, but he has been at great pains to stress just how far he is from this fictionalised version of himself, even though he also landed himself in serious debt after reportedly spending his $150m fortune. “I have a lot of quiet moments at home with just my cat, reading,” he told the Hollywood Reporter last month. “Do we want to show any of that? No, because it’s not fun.” Showing A-list stars on an egotistical rampage – now that’s fun. Usually, when actors portray themselves in films, it’s played for laughs, although there has been the occasional foray into drama. “We don’t really know what an actor is like in reality, so what they’re actually performing is a version of themselves that is known and disseminated in culture, in films and by chatshows,” says Dr Andrew Stubbs, senior lecturer in film, media and communication at Staffordshire University. The most successful performances within this niche tend to either exaggerate an actor’s public image or play against it completely. This is why Bill Murray’s cameo in Zombieland was so effective: he leaned into his off-screen persona as a lovable eccentric, the kind of celebrity who turns up to a stranger’s engagement photoshoot and crashes stag dos. In Zombieland, Murray hides out in his huge mansion as the zombie apocalypse rages on around him, pretending to be one of the undead when he ventures out, which just seems like a very Bill Murray thing to do. Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves’s performance as a smug hipster parody of himself in Always Be My Maybe is a million miles away from his reputation as one of Hollywood’s nicest celebrities, long heralded for being sensitive, humble and unfailingly good natured. Definitely not the kind of person who would inspire an I Punched Keanu Reeves rap from a love rival, as he does in Nahnatchka Khan’s romcom. An actor playing themselves in a film also opens up a chance for reinvention. Take Neil Patrick Harris, who appears as Cage’s agent in The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Before he starred in Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle, he was primarily known for his role as wholesome medical wunderkind Doogie Howser in the US sitcom. His performance as a satirical version of himself in the stoner comedy and the two sequels that followed reinvigorated his career. Playing an arrogant sleazeball with a predilection for vast amounts of cocaine and strippers allowed him to transition into more adult parts. A year later, he joined the cast of How I Met Your Mother as brash womaniser Barney Stinson. “These films are an opportunity to enhance actors’ brands,” says Stubbs. “Taking on these roles, they’re often required to be quite self-conscious and self-deprecating. Those are qualities that are highly valued in our society. So in that sense, it helps the actor to shed any ideas about their egotism.” There have been notable performances from female actors playing themselves in films. Julia Roberts went meta on meta as the wife of a con artist pretending to be Julia Roberts as part of an elaborate heist in Ocean’s Twelve. Then there is Megan Fox’s cameo in The Dictator, which takes a dig at her overly sexualised image, and Emma Watson shows up wielding an axe in apocalyptic comedy This Is the End. But when it comes to celebrities playing themselves, especially in lead roles in films, most of the time, it’s done by a white male actor. Women and people of colour are sidelined in supporting parts, if they appear at all – just as they are in the wider film industry. “Actresses’ careers tend to be shorter, they have fewer opportunities to create a successful career and sustain it through the years, so they have to be much more careful,” says Helen O’Hara, author of Women vs Hollywood: The Fall and Rise of Women in Film. Plus, there’s the ever-persistent misconception that women just aren’t as funny as men. They’re not even being given the opportunity to try, she says. “A lot of these [parts] come along as fun cameos with your friends. The comedy groups tend to be quite close-knit groups of men.” Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, for instance, hammed it up hilariously in a guest appearance spoofing their Good Will Hunting success in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, because they’re friends with the director Kevin Smith. This Is the End features a host of celebrity cameos but the core clique of the film – its co-director Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel and Danny McBride – are close friends who constantly pop up in each other’s films. “Women have much more to lose than men do, if it goes wrong,” says O’Hara. “People are much quicker to believe that women are divas. So it’s much harder to poke fun at themselves while reinforcing those stereotypes, which could be very damaging to their career.” At the same time, these roles might initially seem lighthearted and playful, but in fact they often cast a satirical eye over the myth of stardom: not just how it’s created by an actor and the Hollywood machine, but also how the public buys into it as well. “It can prompt the audience to consider how a star might have been mistreated or misrepresented by paparazzi and the press, and think critically about their star image rather than accepting it at face value,” says Stubbs. Despite a string of classy dramatic roles on stage and screen, John Malkovich’s most celebrated performance is as himself in Being John Malkovich. Director Spike Jonze’s audacious comedy revolves around Craig (John Cusack), a puppeteer who discovers a magical portal into the Dangerous Liaisons actor’s mind – and promptly sets up a business selling tickets for $200 a pop so others can be Malkovich for 15 minutes. Charlie Kaufman’s ingenious script ridicules the emptiness of fame and our worship of celebrities as Malkovich – played with gleeful narcissism as he sends up his dour off-screen persona – starts to unravel spectacularly. And that’s what these roles really are – they provide our own portal to glean what we can about celebrity culture, even though we know what we’re really seeing is a reflection from a distorted mirror, a parody of what we think stardom might be rather than the reality. Still, we’re being invited to be in on the joke and the actor is being such a good sport, so we’ll probably be laughing along, trying not to cringe too hard if it falls flat. The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is in cinemas from 22 April."
"‘If you want to know about sex, it’s in the songs’: Joan Jett on punk, privacy and almost joining the army",2022-04-07T09:00:09Z,Fiona Sturges,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7eb7,"When Joan Jett was 13 years old, she had her first lesson on the electric guitar her parents had given her for Christmas. “I went in there all excited and said to the teacher: ‘I wanna play rock’n’roll,’” she says. “And he said to me: ‘Girls don’t play rock’n’roll. Let me teach you [the folk song] On Top of Old Smokey instead.’” Jett never went back for a second lesson – instead, she bought a book and taught herself to play. It wouldn’t be the last time a man tried to put her in her place: “It’s the hand in the face telling you ‘You can’t do this’ or ‘Don’t do that’,” she says. “And it’s not just in rock’n’roll, it’s everywhere.” This year marks 40 years since I Love Rock’n’Roll, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts’ cover of a song originally by the Arrows, reached No 1 in the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for seven weeks. The Blackhearts were Jett’s second band; her first, the Runaways, in which she played rhythm guitar, had barged their way on to the Los Angeles punk scene in 1976, making their debut with the raucous single Cherry Bomb. By 1979, they had split up. Since those heady, chaotic early years, Jett has barely stopped. At 63, she continues to release albums on her label, Blackheart Records, and, pandemic notwithstanding, tours relentlessly. As the decades have passed, veneration of Jett as a feminist pioneer and all-round force of nature has grown. In 2010, Kristen Stewart played her in the biopic The Runaways (with Dakota Fanning as the band’s singer, Cherie Currie), while in 2018, Bad Reputation, Kevin Kerslake’s documentary named after one of Jett’s signature songs, traced her rise from snarling teen to rock’n’roll grande dame. It’s late afternoon at Jett’s Long Island home when we speak via video call. In a low-ceilinged room illuminated with fairy lights, she is relaxing after a late night playing her first concert in months. “Excuse my casualness here,” she says, slumped in an armchair, iPhone propped up on her knees. Dressed in regulation black vest and jeans, she is toned and athletic-looking. Her hair is just as it ever was: dyed black and heavily layered in the classic rocker’s shag cut. Liza Minnelli in Cabaret was among the inspirations for the teenage Jett’s look. “I loved the androgyny, or the gender-bending thing or however you want to put it,” she reflects. “My image was my armour. It’s not like I went around punching people, but people were intimidated and that was purposeful.” Also on our call is Jett’s longtime manager, producer, co-writer and best pal Kenny Laguna. As a keyboard player in the 1960s, he performed on a string of bubblegum hits including Mony Mony by Tommy James and the Shondells. He and Jett have worked together since 1979, when the Runaways fell apart and she graduated from rhythm guitarist to lead singer of the Blackhearts. As Laguna puts it in the documentary, he brought the pop while she “brought the menace”. Their relationship is entirely platonic – it was Laguna’s wife, Meryl, who suggested he seek out Jett after reading about her in the British music press. Nonetheless, they sound just like a married couple with their bossing and bickering. “Lift your head up, Kenny!” Jett barks at him, when he lets his camera slip. “We can’t see your mouth. It’s very unnerving.” Jett spent much of the pandemic at home going stir-crazy, so she couldn’t be happier to be back on stage. “It’s the longest I’ve ever gone [not performing] since I started in the business. There’s this song that Kenny and I wrote many years ago called You Don’t Know What You’ve Got, and that’s actually the case. It was pretty distressing, but then it was a gift in other ways. It forced you to slow down, and a lot of people have trouble with that, me included.” Along with a tour, there’s a new album, Changeup, a collection of acoustic versions of old tracks including Crimson and Clover and Bad Reputation. Jett loves to find new ways to play old songs – “You find all these nooks and crannies that you didn’t know were there,” she says. When I ask if she feels she might go mad if she has to crank out I Love Rock’n’Roll one more time, she looks appalled: “Not at all. For me, you’re playing it in front of new people every time, so it’s new. It can never be the same. I don’t want to have a lackadaisical attitude about these things. I don’t ever want to fake it.” Jett, who is the eldest of three siblings, credits her work ethic to her parents – her mother was a secretary and her father sold insurance. “I never saw them sitting around being lazy,” she says. “They instilled in me that I could do whatever I wanted to do, but I’d have to work hard at it.” For a while, they lived in Maryland, where Jett’s parents got her a horse. “We weren’t a rich family so I don’t know how they did that. But I’d travel about 40 miles on the weekends and I would take lessons in exchange for cleaning the stables. And I learned something from that.” The family later moved to LA, where Jett started hanging out at Rodney’s English Disco, a Hollywood nightclub that would play “glitter music” by the likes of the Sweet, David Bowie and T Rex. The music impresario Kim Fowley also frequented Rodney’s and put Jett, who was just 16, in touch with a young drummer, Sandy West. Jett went round to West’s house, they jammed for a bit and then called up Fowley and played a song down the phone. He was so impressed that he appointed himself their manager and helped recruit the rest of the band: singer Currie, guitarist Lita Ford and bassist Jackie Fuchs. The Runaways weren’t exactly welcomed with open arms. At gigs, people threw bottles, spat at them and called them sluts. Jett would go backstage and cry. Critics, struggling to get their heads around the notion of an all-girl punk band, dismissed them as a novelty act. “No one gave us any credit that we could play at all,” she says. “And that was really galling because we played better than a lot of the bands we opened for.” Weren’t her parents anxious about her being out all night playing dives? “I’m sure they were but they never said anything,” Jett replies. “They obviously told me to be careful and keep my wits about me. But they knew that I loved what I did.” Her parents had recently separated and, years later, Jett discovered her father used to secretly go to her gigs: “He would stand at the back and I never even knew he was there.” In contrast to their chilly reception in the US, the Runaways were adored in Europe and, for a while, the band set up home on a houseboat in Chelsea in London. “England values rock’n’roll!” pipes up Laguna. “I mean, you guys make rock’n’roll stars knights, right? I guess we canonise our movie stars. The Sex Pistols went to No 1 with pretty raw songs in England, but in America they didn’t do anything. The Runaways had humungous hits in Japan and Scandinavia, but they weren’t even considered by most American radio stations.” What paltry media coverage they got in the US invariably focused on their appearance and sexuality. Early in her career, Jett recalls doing an interview and being asked about sex. “And I thought to myself: ‘Well, here it is. If I answer this question, then every question will be about sex, and they’ll never talk about the music.’ I knew not to discuss my personal sex life ever – and I mean ever – in public, and not to feel bad about it. If they wanted to know about sex, it’s in the songs. It’s all there in the lyrics.” She’s not wrong: anyone curious about Jett’s sexual orientation need only pay attention to the pronouns in her version of Crimson and Clover (“Now I don’t hardly know her, but I think I could love her”). “Because you know everyone else has diarrhoea mouth now, and can’t keep it shut about what they do and who they fuck,” Jett continues. “I think rock’n’roll needs to have mystique. Especially with the way people are on social media – it doesn’t have that mysterious quality any more, which to me is tragic.” The Runaways lasted three-and-a-half years, and Jett had a blast, travelling the world and meeting her heroes, from Ramones to Sid Vicious. But a shadow was cast on the band’s history when, in 2015, Jackie Fuchs alleged that Fowley raped her at an aftershow party while she was incapacitated on quaaludes, in full view of Currie and Jett. Fowley died six months before Fuchs went public with the allegations. Both Jett and Currie issued statements denying having witnessed the assault. Jett wrote: “Anyone who truly knows me understands that if I was aware of a friend or a bandmate being violated, I would not stand by while it happened.” I ask Jett if the allegations led her to re-evaluate Fowley and her time in the band. There is a pause and she shakes her head. “I mean, Kim and I were friends. We got along, I wrote songs with him … I don’t know what else to say about it really.” When the Runaways split in 1979, musical differences were cited, though Jett was also uncomfortable at the way the band were being marketed. A photoshoot in which Currie was seen reclining in a corset was a particular source of ire. After the band went their separate ways, Jett started drinking heavily (she’s all but teetotal now) and developed a heart infection that landed her in hospital. During her recovery, she toyed with joining the army. “I knew I could use some discipline and direction,” she reflects. Jett says she has always felt a strong kinship with soldiers, and has played shows for troops in Kuwait, Kosovo, Iraq, Uzbekistan, Puerto Rico, Oman and beyond. “I feel connected to the military because I almost joined. Like now, when you see countries [like Ukraine] really fighting for freedom, it’s very moving and I know not to take that freedom for granted.” Jett was at her lowest ebb when she met Laguna. When I ask her if it was him that pulled her up and stopped her from self-destructing, she replies: “Absolutely. I had hope. Someone that believed in me. Nobody believed in me and all of a sudden this guy comes out of nowhere and writes songs with me. And then he hung around me and started to like me.” “Love you,” corrects Laguna gently, and Jett’s eyes suddenly fill with tears and she sniffs: “I’m getting emotional, sorry. I’m gonna put the phone down for a second. Kenny, you talk.” Laguna reminds me that Jett was 15 when she started writing songs. “The first song she ever wrote was You Drive Me Wild. When Wanda Jackson heard it, she went nuts. She said: ‘I’ve gotta record this.’ Joan was a little kid writing this stuff. Her poetry was overlooked partly because of the electric [guitars] but also because people weren’t taking women rock’n’rollers seriously. If she’d been a guy, they’d have treated her like Tom Petty or Bob Dylan.” Laguna and Jett still have the rejection letters from the record companies that passed on their Blackhearts demos – all 23 of them. Rather than throw in the towel, they started their own label and sold records at shows. For a time, Laguna’s Cadillac was the company office (the label is now run by his daughter and Jett’s goddaughter, Carianne Brinkman). The release of I Love Rock’n’Roll in 1982 coincided with the rise of MTV and suddenly they were everywhere. The single sold 10m copies and the band were soon playing stadiums. Jett is back, the tears all gone. I remark that she seems to have taken several younger musicians under her wing over the years. Bikini Kill’s Kathleen Hanna, whose biggest single Rebel Girl was produced by Jett, has said she is “like family”. She is also close to Miley Cyrus, who covers Cherry Bomb at concerts, and who gave a speech thanking Jett “for fighting for our freedom” when she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. “I always try to make sure that I connect with and support [young women] in any way I can,” she says. “Most of the time they’re going through the same things that I’ve been through many times over.” Despite this, talk of her legacy makes her uncomfortable. Jett doesn’t like to be put on a pedestal. “When people say “punk queen”, I’m, like, you got Patti Smith, man, you can’t compete with that. I want to be ‘a’ one rather than ‘the’ one, otherwise the only way is down. There’s this Maya Angelou quote which says: ‘People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel.’ I just wanna make people feel good.” Changeup by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts is out now on Blackheart Records."
Major NSW flood warnings and evacuation orders in place as heavy rain continues – as it happened,2022-04-06T21:28:22Z,Caitlin Cassidy and Matilda Boseley,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7yhy,"With that, we will wrap up the blog for the evening. New South Wales readers, stay safe and dry tonight. Here were today’s major developments: A number of flood evacuation orders remain in place in New South Wales as heavy rain continues to hit Sydney and surrounds. The Nepean River is sitting at 16.8 metres at Menangle and is expected to reach similar levels to the 1988 flood. A severe weather warning has been issued by the Bureau of Meteorology covering Sydney, the Illawarra and the south coast, as well as parts of Hunter, central tablelands and southern tablelands districts. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, has announced new sanctions on Russia on a Nato trip to Belgium; however, she has resisted pressure to expel Russian diplomats from Australia. An estimated 20 asylum seekers have been released from detention in Australia, including the final eight residents detained in Melbourne’s Park hotel. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, has adopted a long-awaited recovery plan for the koala. The PM has confirmed the federal government will go halves with Queensland on a flood funding package. And the Victorian government will provide free rapid antigen tests for all Victorians with a disability. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, has released a statement confirming Australia will partner with the Nato strategic communications centre of excellence to address hybrid threats and counter disinformation. You can peruse the full report from the Senate select committee on Covid-19 here. It recommends, among other things, a royal commission into the pandemic response to be established by the next federal government. Major flooding is continuing to occur at Menangle along the Nepean River with levels in excess of last month’s flood. The river is currently sitting at 16.8 metres at Menangle Bridge, similar to the April 1988 flood, which peaked at 16.75 metres. Renewed rises of about 17 metres are possible later this evening, the BoM says. Major flooding is also expected at Wallacia and possible at Camden along the Nepean from this evening. Camden Weir is likely to reach about 12.8 metres this evening with further rises possible overnight in excess of the March 2022 peak. At the Wallacia Weir, the river may reach about 14.4 metres tomorrow morning, similar to the 1988 peak of 14.33 metres. Major flooding is also “likely” at North Richmond along the Hawkesbury from tomorrow, with river levels likely to remain below a peak last month. Here’s the latest from the bureau: A deepening coastal trough has been producing heavy rainfall over the Hawkesbury Nepean Valley since Wednesday evening, with rainfall expected to continue for the remainder of Thursday and into Friday. River level rises have been observed across the Hawkesbury Nepean Valley and are expected to rise further with forecast rain. Major flooding is occurring along the Upper Nepean River at levels higher than the March 2022 and similar to the April 1988 floods with further rises possible. Warragamba dam is spilling. Major flooding is likely along the Hawkesbury River at North Richmond from early Friday as a result of significant flows from the Upper Nepean and widespread rainfall. Predictions for Lower Portland and Wisemans Ferry will be provided after upstream peaks are observed. A Severe Weather Warning is current for heavy rainfall in the Metropolitan, Illawarra, South Coast and parts of Hunter, Central Tablelands and Southern Tablelands Forecast Districts. A Flood Watch is current for the Upper Coxs and Macdonald Rivers. It appears 32 hospitalisations were missed in the Victorian government’s Covid update today. Stepping back for a minute, here’s the current flooding situation in New South Wales. Evacuation orders are currently in place for parts of Camden, Chipping Norton, low-lying parts of Woronora and Bonnet Bay, and Bungawalbin. A number of evacuation warnings are also in place covering parts of Wallacia Weir, parts of Camden, Stonequarry Creek at Picton, Stuarts Point and surrounding areas. Access the full NSW SES advice here. The Bureau of Meteorology has listed severe weather warnings for metropolitan Sydney, Illawarra, South Coast and parts of the Hunter, Central Tablelands and Southern Tablelands with heavy rain expected to continue into the evening. A road weather alert is active for all of Sydney, and a marine wind and hazardous surf warning is in place for the state. There are 10 active flood warnings in NSW, with major flooding occurring at Menangle and expected to exceed the floods of 20 March and April 1988. Major flooding is also expected along the Nepean at Wallacia and is possible at Camden this evening. Major flooding is also possible at North Richmond along the Hawkesbury River, however flood levels are likely to remain below the peak reached last month. If you’re in Sydney right now – this won’t come as a surprise. It’s bucketing. “People know who I am” is definitely a useful first step to getting elected. Back to 2GB, and Payne was asked about growing calls to expel Russian diplomats based in Australia. We absolutely do communicate with them ... I know this is a point of some interest and I think it’s important to realise that from my part, having a diplomatic path to discuss these issues can be very important. I’m also conscious there are hundreds and hundreds of Australians in Russia. Dare he take a cheeky ride on the carousel? Payne just spoke to 2GB from Brussels prior to heading to Nato meetings. She said Ukraine would be the “complete focus” of the meeting and Australia was “very pleased to be able to participate as a close partner of Nato”. Asked whether sanctions have worked, she said they were having a “real effect” due to the “extensive global coordination amongst partners”. The horror is almost unspeakable and we see it every day, but I do think Australians can be proud of the effort our country is making to support Ukraine and work so closely with our partners. As was previously mentioned, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, unveiled further sanctions on Russia while speaking in Belgium today. Targeted financial sanctions and travel bans have been announced for a further 67 individuals “for their role in Russia’s unprovoked, unjust and illegal invasion of Ukraine”. The latest round of sanctions follows the emerging evidence of war crimes committed by Russia in Bucha, which has seen widespread global condemnation including the expulsion of Russian diplomats from EU countries. Payne’s statement reads: Australia condemns these atrocities in the strongest possible terms. Those sanctioned include prominent Russian military official Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, who has been described as the “Butcher of Mariupol”, for attacks including the bombing of the theatre in which innocent civilians were sheltering in Mariupol. They also include deputy prime minister Dmitry Grigorenko, minister of economic development Maxim Reshetnikov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma, Aleksander Babakov, and other senior Russian government officials. In addition, we are also listing the Kremlin-installed so-called “mayor” of Melitopol, Ukrainian Galina Danilchenko, and a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, Oleg Voloshyn, who has been working with Russia to undermine the Ukrainian Government. With these latest listings, the Australian Government has now sanctioned close to 600 individuals and entities in relation to Russia’s illegal war. Another evacuation warning has just been listed as the Nepean River continues to rise, this time for parts of Wallacia covering: All properties along Bents Basin Rd Beres Creek, Scotchys Creek &amp; Baines Creek All properties between Silverdale Rd &amp; Nepean River A number of evacuation warnings are in place in parts of Sydney’s Camden, covering: Argyle St Lerida St Elizabeth St Mitchell St Ulmarra St Peter Ave Edward St At 3pm, the Bureau of Meteorology warned major flooding was expected along the Nepean River at Wallacia and was possible at Camden from this evening: Major flooding is occurring along the Upper Nepean River at Menangle and moderate flooding is occurring at Camden. Major flooding is possible at Camden and Wallacia. Flooding higher than the March 2022 and April 1988 floods is expected along the Upper Nepean River. The Nepean River at Menangle Bridge may reach around 17 metres Thursday evening, higher than the March 2022 and April 1988 flood peaks. Further rises are possible. The Nepean River at Camden Weir may reach the major flood level (13.80m) Thursday evening, higher than the March 2022 flood peak. George Christensen has resigned from the Liberal National party, writing in a resignation letter it is “no longer my party” and “seems anything but conservative”. Foreign minister Marise Payne has announced new sanctions will be imposed on Russia. The government has been under pressure as to why it hasn’t expelled Russian diplomats from Australia following the Bucha killings as have EU nations. Speaking of which: 7News is reporting crews are attempting to rescue five people who have become stranded in floodwaters in Camden, south-west of the Sydney CBD. Zimmerman is asked about the high court challenge to the PM’s right to intervene in the NSW preselections. He says its been “enormously frustrating” as a potential candidate and there are “lessons to be learned” on the other side of the election. But we have had a decision of the New South Wales court of appeal which upheld the actions that the federal executive of the party took. It’s the right of an applicant in this case to go to the high court. I assume that they will resolve it very quickly. But from my perspective I’m just getting on with the job. Asked whether he welcomed the intervention by the PM, he says: I was happy to have a full pre-selection and I like to think I would have prevailed in those circumstances ... I made clear to party officials I would have preferred a full pre-selection. But the PM explained some of the things going through his mind. The Liberal MP for North Sydney, Trent Zimmerman, is up on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. Asked when the PM will call the election, he says “I think it’s a matter of days” and we ought to be patient. We can be patient for a little bit longer and we know it will be mid-May. We have to be a little bit patient for a few more days and a few more hours. Asked what the hold up is, Zimmerman says its to do with the pre-selection challenge and the campaign is “effectively underway” anyway. It is going to be one of two weekends in May, the campaign’s effectively underway. I think we can get a little bit hang up about the day on which he goes to Yarralumla, but I don’t think we have long to wait. Speaking of New South Wales, the state is still getting inundated with rain, with no reprieve expected this evening. The NSW Council for Civil Liberties has just released its assessment of the major parties’ policy positions on a range of human rights and civil liberties issues, including refugee and asylum seeker policy, First Nations justice, and anti-discrimination laws. CCL gave the Liberals a “comprehensive fail”. Labor was recorded as “scraping a pass mark” on half of the policy issues. Parties and candidates were asked for their positions on: Enshrining a human rights act. Ending inhumane treatment of refugees. First Nations justice. Protecting Australians from discrimination. Achieving gender equity. Defending our right to know. Preventing excessive surveillance and privacy intrusions. Pursuing integrity and a working democracy. Fighting the climate crisis. Curbing out-of-control national security laws. Other civil liberties issues. The Liberal party’s policies were rated strongly negative or negative across all 11 areas. You can see the full results here. The Australian Human Rights Commission’s “A status” ranking may be downgraded if steps aren’t taken to ensure an open merit-based selection process for future commonwealth appointments. The Human Rights Law Centre, the Australian Human Rights Institute and Amnesty International Australia have called on the federal government to ensure the commission upholds independent and effective standards following the revelations. The global body that accredits national human rights watchdogs issued the warning following the federal government’s hand-picking of Lorraine Finlay to be human rights commissioner last year without an open selection process. Finlay was appointed for a five-year term and replaced the outgoing commissioner, Ed Santow. In 2019, Ben Gauntlett was hand-picked to be disability discrimination commissioner, also without an open, merit-based selection process. Gauntlett filled the vacancy created after the outgoing commissioner, Alastair McEwin, was appointed to the disability royal commission. Last month, the commission also warned that its current funding “does not provide us with the resources required to perform our statutory functions” and said jobs at the agency would need to be cut. The Human Rights Law Centre’s executive director, Hugh de Kretser, said the Morrison government had “undermined” the independence and effectiveness of the commission by making appointments without a public, merit-based selection process. The Morrison government’s actions have jeopardised our national human rights watchdog at a critical time for human rights, both at home and globally. Australia can and should lead the world on human rights. Instead of leading, the Morrison government is embarrassing us on the world stage. The Morrison government must commit to reforms to ensure open merit-based selection processes for future commissioner appointments, and to adequately funding the commission so it can properly do its important work.” The Australian Human Rights Institute director, Justine Nolan, said a status downgrade could “severely damage” the legitimacy of the commission. The Australian Human Rights Commission’s current ‘A status’ means it has full participation rights at the UN Human Rights Council, the right to attend and speak up at UN meetings. Partially compliant human rights commissions are given ‘B status’ and may only participate as observers. They are essentially works in progress. Among the countries in this class are Myanmar, Venezuela, Chad, Libya and Bahrain. Toyota could be forced to pay out almost $2bn to Australian customers who were sold cars with faulty engine filters, after the auto giant lost a class action lawsuit, AAP reports. In a federal court judgment handed down on Thursday, Justice Michael Lee found thousands of people who bought some of the brand’s top-selling cars were eligible for a payout. The class action alleged Hilux, Fortuner and Prado vehicles sold between October 2015 and April 2020 had defective diesel particulate filter systems, leaving owners out of pocket. The defect caused the vehicles to spill foul-smelling white smoke and meant owners had to fork out for an excessive number of inspections, services and repairs. Justice Lee found 264,170 vehicles were sold with the defect in Australia, and each was worth 17.5% less than what the average customer paid. “The conduct in marketing the vehicles as being of acceptable quality was misleading,” Justice Lee wrote. If each customer claimed the full amount - $7474.59 - back, the bill for Toyota could reach about $2bn. The Bureau of Meteorology has released its latest update for New South Wales, where heavy rainfall continues. A major flood warning is in place for the Hawkesbury and Nepean Valley, while minor flooding is possible for the central and south coast rivers from this afternoon: Heavy rainfall has been recorded over the central and southern NSW coast since Wednesday evening and has resulted in minor to major flooding. This rainfall is expected to continue over metropolitan Sydney, Illawarra and parts of the South Coast and Southern Tablelands over the next 12 to 24 hours and may cause minor flooding in the Central Coast and Moruya Rivers from Thursday afternoon into Friday. Flood warnings are current for the Hawkesbury and Nepean Rivers, Georges and Woronora, Cooks, Shoalhaven, St Georges Basin, Richmond, Orara, Paroo, Culgoa, Birrie, Bokhara and Narran, Snowy (Victoria), and Macintyre River (Queensland) Rivers. Flooding is no longer expected in the Macquarie River to Bathurst and Queanbeyan Rivers. The Senate select committee on Covid-19 has recommend the next federal government establish a royal commission into the pandemic response. In its final report issued today its chair, senator Katy Gallagher, says the commonwealth was “unprepared” when the pandemic hit, “responded too slowly, ignored expert advice and failed to take responsibility when things went wrong”. Residents in parts of Camden have been ordered to evacuate as rainfall continues to lash large parts of New South Wales. The order covers: Exeter Street west of John Street Milford Road, Camden West Peter Avenue between Onslow Avenue and Belgenny Avenue Firefighters are still battling to contain a blaze in Melbourne’s Brunswick East. Melbourne’s Park Hotel has been emptied following the release of around 20 refugees from onshore detention today. They join 230 people released since December 2020, with 10 remaining in detention. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said of the 20 people released, eight were estimated to be from Park Hotel in Melbourne, six were from Brisbane Immigration Transit Accomodation (ITA), three were from Melbourne ITA and the remaining refugees were from other detention centres around Australia. The ASRC said the estimates were made “in lieu of any transparent communication” with the federal government nor explanation for why the further 10 refugees remained detained. Thanush Selvarasa, human rights activist and refugee released from detention last year, said it was “wonderful news”. We have been waiting day by day for the last nine years to join the community, you cannot imagine how happy this makes me. Nobody knows how valuable this news is for me and my friends. This is a victory not just for us but for all those who fought for our freedom. But this is the beginning, we need permanent protection visas, we cannot rebuild our life on a temporary visa. But anything is better than detention. ASRC’s director of advocacy and campaigns, Jana Favero, said the centre had been waiting for this moment for nine years. Nine years too long, refugees are granted the freedom they deserve. This highlights the sheer cruelty and viciousness of our policies – that so many can suddenly be released and a handful remain. All remaining must be released immediately. Dr Graham Thom, Amnesty International Australia refugee advisor said the delay in releasing the men from the Park Hotel was “inexcusable”: Three months since the world’s media watched Novak Djokovic come and go from the Park hotel, the refugees who were detained alongside him are finally free. Sadly these men were unnecessarily detained for more than two years in hotels in Australia, following the years of trauma they suffered offshore. The delay in releasing them is inexcusable as is the ongoing detention of other Medevac refugees in other centres around Australia. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 33 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 1,094 In hospital: 49 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 16 Cases: 22,255 In hospital: 1,437 (with 48 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 513 In hospital: 24 (with 1 person in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 7 Cases: 10,984 In hospital: 444 (with 17 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 6,091 In hospital: 210 (with 12 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 0 Cases: 2,365 In hospital: 43 (with 1 person in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 4 Cases: 12,314 In hospital: 315 (with 12 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 7,998 In hospital: 256 (with 8 people in ICU) Clive Palmer has suggested his United Australia Party could direct supporters to preference sitting MPs last at the coming election, potentially causing headaches for the Coalition in tight races across the country. The mining billionaire also admitted his party may spend less on advertising at the coming election than the 2019 campaign, and distanced himself from incendiary conspiracy comments made at anti-vaccine protests which were partially funded by the UAP. Palmer, the one-time federal MP, is seeking a return and running for the Senate. Addressing the National Press Club on Thursday, he said the UAP would not list the Coalition, Labor or the Greens on their how-to-vote cards in the Senate at all, and instead would suggest their supporters back other parties in the upper house. In the House of Representatives, where voters have to number every candidate in order of preference, Palmer said the UAP would put the three major parties “at the bottom of that ticket: We can’t determine at this stage who will be out of the last three but they’ll all be last three. When pressed, he said there was no “clear-cut” decision on which party would be at the very bottom of the preference list, but suggested there could be exceptions for MPs who had supported UAP MP Craig Kelly’s pet issues – such as opposing Covid vaccine mandates and lockdowns: Those people will be favourable when it comes to us. But there’s a situation where the Liberal Party locked down Sydney. A lot of our party members are very upset about that still. From my personal perspective, I think I put the Greens ahead of Liberal and Labor. That’s my personal perspective. Because they haven’t been in government and haven’t been responsible for this debt. South Australia has released today’s Covid update. There are 6,091 new Covid cases in the state, bringing active cases to 35,984. Sadly, there have been three further deaths. There are 210 people being treated in hospital with the virus including 12 people requiring intensive care. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, has adopted a long-awaited recovery plan for the koala. The plan was identified a decade ago as a requirement for the koala populations of New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory and should have been in place after a national koala strategy expired in 2014. But the recovery plan was never developed and for years the koala was among about 170 threatened species and habitats with plans that were overdue. After the Black Summer bushfires, Ley accelerated work on the plan and confirmed it would be adopted when the koala was listed in February as endangered – up from vulnerable. She has released the plan today with the NSW and ACT governments. The overall goal of the plan is to stop the decline of the threatened koala populations in NSW, Queensland and the ACT but it also considers management of healthier populations in Victoria and South Australia. Ley says it will coordinate action across all levels of government and will produce significant improvements for endangered populations in Queensland, NSW and the ACT. Actions under the plan include the identification of nationally important populations, national monitoring, restoration of habitat, and community education in urban and peri-urban areas. The plan has three main objectives. They include stabilising and then increasing the area of occupancy and size of populations that are currently believed to be decreasing, and maintaining and then increasing those populations whose numbers are currently stable. It calls for several actions over a five year period, including more monitoring and research. Increasing the overall area of protected koala habitat is identified as “essential”, including through private land purchases and the dedication of more crown land to the protected estate. The plan also calls for the investigation of whether koala habitat could be added to the national critical habitat register. Were this to occur, it would be the first time since 2005 any new habitat for any species has been added to the register. It’s an Easter nightmare! Ferrero Australia is recalling a string of Kinder products from stores for potential salmonella contamination. The products have been available for sale nationally at Coles, Woolworths, Target, Kmart, Big W, independent food retailers including IGA and petrol stations, and online. Consumers should not eat this product and should return the products to the place of purchase for a full refund. Any consumers concerned about their health should seek medical advice. The search continues for missing woman Beryl Collins in Alice Springs, who was last seen on 14 March. A land search with officers on motorbikes was deployed today to search an 11km stretch of roadside outbound from Larapinta Drive, after further investigations revealed she was last seen walking in the area. Snr Sgt Michael Potts said investigations revealed Beryl was last seen walking near the Albrecht and Larapinta Drive intersection early that morning: At the time, Beryl was wearing a grey coloured skirt, a dark coloured top and wearing a black backpack, we believed to be filled with groceries. Police and family hold concerns for her welfare as she has underlying medical conditions: The possibilities are endless in that Beryl could be have been picked up by family or friends and is currently staying somewhere and unaware that she’s missing, or that she is lost. The high court will hear Matthew Camenzuli’s urgent application for special leave to challenge NSW Liberal preselections at 4pm on Friday. At the hearing on Thursday Guy Reynolds, representing Scott Morrison, Dominic Perrottet and others, argued that an attempt to join several NSW Liberal officials to the proceedings in order to restrain them from submitting the endorsed candidates’ names to the electoral commission was an “abuse of process”. That was because that aspect of the case had not been pleaded and argued in the NSW supreme court and court of appeal, Reynolds said. Reynolds said: The plaintiff, as a result of his expulsion, will have no argument as to his standing. As Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday, Camenzuli was ejected from the Liberal party using special campaign powers based on an allegation he has imperilled the party’s election chances by challenging the preselection of 12 candidates. Justice Stephen Gageler agreed to expedite leave to appeal. He ordered the respondents to file documents by 1pm, with Camenzuli to reply by 3pm. The court will hear the special leave application at 4pm on Friday. No order was made about joining the NSW Liberal officials. If you’re in need of cheering up (who isn’t? It’s 2022!) cast your eyes to this moment in history from a simpler, purer time. Ten years ago today, field commentator and former AFL player Brett Kirk delivered this stunning speech from the Essendon rooms. 3AW Melbourne is reporting more than 60 firefighters are battling the large factory fire on John Street, Brunswick East. Labor MP Andrew Leigh has just announced the party will double philanthropy efforts by 2030 if it is elected. He is light on the details as to how this would be achieved but if successful it would bring Australia’s charitable donations are a share of GDP in line with countries like New Zealand. If elected, Labor would direct Treasury to collaborate with the philanthropic, for-purpose and business sectors to set a strategic direction for philanthropy in Australia. Working closely with those on the frontline, the Treasury-led process would chart key issues, opportunities and obstacles, in order to identify a suite of initiatives to double philanthropic giving by the end of the decade. China is “enabling Russia’s conduct” in Ukraine despite professing neutrality on the conflict, a senior official from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has said. The comments from Justin Hayhurst, the deputy secretary of Dfat, give an insight into the assessments officials are giving the Australian government regarding the increasing alignment between China and Russia. Australia has been pressing China to use its influence to urge Russia to pull back from Ukraine. Appearing at a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra, Hayhurst was asked about the so-called “no limits” partnership announced by China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin in early February, at the beginning of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Russia invaded Ukraine three weeks later. Hayhurst said: Our view of this partnership remains that it is a strategic alignment of concern. It’s an overt challenge, in our way of thinking, to the international order. And although China professes neutrality in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it is in fact enabling Russia’s conduct. Moreover, we’re watching with growing concerns as China media and propaganda outlets amplify Russian disinformation about the conflict. The other thing that I would say is an aspect of the joint statement released when the two leaders met in Beijing centred very much around a common view about Nato and alliances, and again our assessment is that China’s fundamental position is that the United States and Nato is somehow to blame for these events. It’s a view, of course, we do not share. Asked whether China’s actions and public statements in relation to the invasion of Ukraine clash with its professed foreign policy orthodoxies of the respect for sovereignty and non-interference, Hayhurst said: Well, at the risk of disappearing down rabbit holes, China’s view is that it’s not inconsistent, but I think by any reasonable understanding of support for territorial integrity and sovereignty, no country should be able to support, tacitly or otherwise, Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether China believed it was suffering any costs, internationally, from Russia’s actions so soon after the countries announced their no-limits partnership, Hayhurst said it would “take a long time for the [Chinese] system possibly to formally adjust and for real evidence to emerge”. But our assessment is there are costs, because it calls into question what China says are fundamental tenets of its foreign policy such as respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. An evacuation order has been listed for parts of Chipping Norton covering: Newbridge Road between Riverside Road and east to Georges River Davy Robinson Drive Rickard Road Arthur Street In Melbourne, firefighters are battling a large blaze in Brunswick East. Greens immigration spokesperson Nick McKim has released a statement in response to the release of asylum seekers from hotel and immigration detention, calling it a “welcome and overdue” development. This is belated but welcome news, and their relief will be massive, but this is not the end of their story. That they are being released on the eve of an election is a deeply cynical move and it proves once again that their detention and torture was always a political decision. None of the people freed today, and none of the people in Australia who were exiled to Manus Island or Nauru nearly a decade ago, have permanent freedom or safety. This release leaves a small number of people who were transferred to Australia for medical reasons still in detention. There are no security concerns over any of these people and they should be freed immediately. McKim notes there are more than 100 people still in Papua New Guinea who aren’t covered by the Australia and New Zealand resettlement agreement. We should offer permanent protection in Australia to anyone who was detained offshore. This has been a dark and bloody chapter in Australia’s national story, and its conclusion has not yet been written. Refugee Action Coalition spokesperson Ian Rintoul says another two people from a Perth detention centre and one person from an Adelaide detention centre are expecting to be released today. That brings the total estimate of releases from immigration detention to 20 people. Earlier, refugees and advocates confirmed to Guardian Australia that up to 17 people were expecting to be freed from detention centres in Melbourne and Brisbane. That estimate included all eight asylum seekers detained at Carlton’s Park Hotel. The Department of Home Affairs told the Senate on Monday they were considering the release of around 25 asylum seekers who are currently detained onshore, which would leave around six asylum seekers in detention. Austin is asked how his crews are responding to these seemingly endless weather events. “You must be exhausted”. He agrees: The SES volunteers supported by all our partner agencies have done an amazing job. Not only over the last six to seven weeks, but really it’s been ... two to three years almost of continuous operations across the state. They continue to turn up. As I keep saying, it is very much a team effort and we thank their employers, particularly, for letting them go. We also thank their families for letting them go ... morale is high. People are out there helping the community in their communities. As has been reported, Sydney has received a record 1226.8mm of rain this year - nearly 200mm higher than the previous record in 1956. The spokesperson from the Bureau – I didn’t catch their name – is asked if there will be a reprieve from the rainfall and flash flooding that has been saturating the state for the greater part of the year. They say the La Niña event is expected to continue for the remainder of the month. So unfortunately we continue to be in a La Niña event which we know for New South Wales means that we can expect to see higher-than-average rainfall conditions, which is exactly what we have seen over the past couple of months, and we are expecting La Niña to continue throughout the remainder of April. Austin says “exceptionally sharp, short bursts of rain” have seen more than six flash flooding rescues in the past 24 hours for people caught out in the wild weather. Once again we ask people to limit any non-essential travel through the area to make sure that they don’t put themselves nor their rescuers at risk. At this point in time, the New South Wales SES has in excess of 500 volunteers supported by our partner agencies ... they’re currently active out in the field and have been overnight and will continue to be through the day ... This is a highly dynamic situation. These events are moving exceptionally quickly as was witnessed in the Illawarra this morning where we saw, in the space of about three-quarters of an hour, significant downpours, significant flash flooding as I mentioned, and a number of properties impacted by those flash events. The New South Wales State Emergency Service acting commissioner, Daniel Austin, says there have been more than 680 requests for assistance responded to in the past 24 hours. There have been 25 flood rescues. Over the last 24 hours, the New South Wales SES together with its partner agencies has responded to in excess of over 680 requests for assistance as a result of the weather system that we’re seeing move through the Sydney metropolitan area, the Illawarra, the South Coast and surrounding areas. Included in that, there have been 25 flood rescues undertaken. The majority of which result from flash flooding and people being caught out by significant downpours of rain, particularly in the Sydney basin and also through the Illawarra. There is also a major flood warning in place for Camden, which should reach a major flood level later this evening surpassing the March 2022 event. Major flooding is also possible in North Richmond but expected to be lower than it was last month. There the potential for major flooding along the Georges River at Liverpool and Milperra from Thursday afternoon: What I’d really urge the residents in these areas to do today and into tomorrow and the weekend is to keep up-to-date with the latest warnings and forecasts as we are already experiencing, and have forecasts for, major flooding in these areas. There is also the significant risk of continued flash flooding in the greater Sydney, Upper Hunter, Illawarra and south coast areas from today and into the weekend. So I’m really urging residents to stay up-to-date with the local weather and warning information and stay safe. Authorities say flooding may surpass the 1988 level at Menangle later this evening. We do have a flood watch in place which is a heads up for potential flooding in the greater Sydney area, Upper Hunter, Illawarra and south coast, in most of these locations for minor flooding. The exception is the areas that we are already experiencing flooding, where we have current flood warnings, for the Hawkesbury-Nepean Rivers, the Georges River and the Cooks River. We are already experiencing major flooding for the community at Menangle, and we have forecast for the major flood peak to occur later this evening and that will be near the April 1988 flood level. This is higher than the March 21 and 22 flood levels. Authorities in Wollongong are giving an update on the unfolding weather situation in New South Wales. Unfortunately, very heavy rainfall lashing the state isn’t expected to ease until this evening. As many residents in the greater Sydney area, Illawarra and South Coast would have experienced overnight and earlier today, very heavy rainfall has been occurring and is forecast to continue to occur for the remainder of today in the Hunter, parts of the Central Coast, greater Sydney, Illawarra and south coast areas. We’re not expecting to see the easing of this very heavy rainfall until this evening where we will see the continuation of rainfall in these areas throughout Friday and over the weekend. We may also see moderate rainfall in parts of the Upper Macquarie, Bogan and Lachlan Rivers from Friday into Saturday. Meanwhile, United Australia’s Clive Palmer has been speaking at the National Press Club. Further to the previous tweets, all of the eight asylum seekers detained in Park Hotel are expected to be released from detention today and granted bridging visas, refuges and advocates have told Guardian Australia. Three asylum seekers from Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation and six asylum seekers from Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation are also expected to be freed today. It’s often hard to confirm exact numbers of releases from immigration detention. However, Guardian Australia has contacted the Australian Border Force for confirmation. Here’s the latest from the Bureau of Meteorology on the evolving situation in New South Wales. Major flood warnings are currently in place for the Hawkesbury and Nepean Valley and the Georges and Worona Rivers. Minor flooding is possible for the Central and South Coast rivers from later this afternoon. Heavy rainfall has been recorded over the central and southern NSW coast since Wednesday evening and has resulted in minor to major flooding. This rainfall is expected to continue over Metropolitan Sydney, the Illawarra and parts of the South Coast and Southern Tablelands over the next 12 to 24 hours and may cause minor flooding in the Central Coast, Shoalhaven, Clyde and Moruya Rivers from Thursday afternoon into Friday. A severe weather warning is current for heavy rainfall for the Metropolitan, Illawarra, South Coast and parts of Hunter, Central Tablelands and Southern Tablelands Forecast Districts. Mehdi Ali was resettled in the US last month after years languishing in Melbourne’s Park Hotel. More detainees are expected to be released from detention across Brisbane and Melbourne. There will no longer be any men detained at the Park Hotel. The Victorian government will provide free rapid antigen tests for all Victorians with a disability, Australian of the year recipient Dylan Alcott has announced on premier Daniel Andrews’ social media: RATs will be available from Saturday at current testing sites and through disability liaisons officers. People will need evidence of eligibility, such as an NDIS statement, to collect up to 20 at a time. Earlier this year, Alcott called for RATs and N95 masks to be free for all Australians living with a disability. I’m so stoked this has happened, I hope the rest of the country follows suit ... so people with a disability can get out there and start living their lives in a safer way. We will be hearing from the NSW SES at 1pm today. There are currently five active evacuation orders covering low-lying parts of Woronora, Bonnet Bay and Bungawalbin as rain again lashes the state. There are also three evacuation warnings in place for parts of Camden, Stonequarry Creek, Stuarts Point and surrounds. Our Queensland state reporter Eden Gillespie is reporting there are 11 expected releases from Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation (Mita) and the Park Hotel including Mustafa, 23, and his father. Many thanks to the magnificent Matilda Boseley for guiding us through this busy morning. I’ll be with you for the rest of the day. With that, I shall hand you over to the amazing Caitlin Cassidy who will take you through this afternoon’s news. Scott Morrison has been berated at length by a man angry about pensions and his government’s failure to legislate a federal integrity commission during a visit to a pub yesterday in regional New South Wales. The prime minister on Thursday shrugged off the exchange from the night before, saying he was “keen to understand” the man’s issues and that he enjoyed hearing from people in the community. Morrison’s fiery encounter came just hours after Anthony Albanese had an unexpected interruption of his own, as a Perth man strolled into the Labor leader’s press conference wanting to ask a “tough question”. You can read the full report below: Here is a little nightmare fuel to make your day worse: The South Australian chief health officer has been booed and jeered by anti-vaccine protesters as she exits the supreme court in Adelaide. The NSE SES has ordered the evacuation of the following areas in and around the outer Sydney suburb of Camden, due to rising floodwaters. If you can’t see the tweet, those areas are: Sheathers Lane and Kirkham Lane Poplar Caravan Park Menangle Road near Racecourse Road may be isolated Some more shots from our photographer-at-large, Mike Bowers, down in southern Sydney. Some images of a the landslide that has closed one lane of Lawrence Hargrave Drive near the Seacliff Bridge at Coalcliff, south of Sydney. Just some casual end of the world thing. A survey of more than 10,000 Australians has found overwhelming support for a suite of integrity reforms, including the establishment of a strong and well-resourced federal anti-corruption commission. The #OurDemocracy campaign, organised by a network of leading not-for-profits, surveyed 10,375 Australians across every federal electorate to gauge support for reforms to donation laws, political advertising, and the lobbyist regime. A staggering 96.7% agreed or strongly agreed that a federal corruption watchdog should be established, something which the Coalition promised but failed to legislate. More than 98% agreed or strongly agreed that Australia should adopt truth in political advertising laws at a federal level. The same proportion of respondents wanted transparency on political donations. About 96% agreed or strongly agreed they wanted greater transparency over the interaction between lobbyists and politicians. The Australian Democracy Network, the group behind the survey, said the survey was conducted via letterboxing, face-to-face interactions at town centres, engaging neighbours, and asking the membership and followers of its not-for-profit partners. Australia Democracy Network executive director Saffron Zomer said: Whoever forms government after the election will have a strong mandate to make a robust, federal integrity commission a legislative priority. Australian Conservation Foundation democracy campaigner Jolene Elberth said: Gathering the results of this survey has been a huge community engagement exercise in itself, with hundreds of community members letterboxing, talking to fellow residents in town centres, and engaging their neighbours in what they want to see to improve Australian democracy. You can see the full survey results here. Anthony Albanese: I’m campaigning for a majority Labor government and I am the only person running for prime minister in this election who is saying that I will seek to form government in my own right. That is what I am asking for, I am asking for people to vote Labor. We have seen Scott Morrison with part of a Coalition now with the National party, whereby Barnaby Joyce gets to decide the climate change policy is for this government. No wonder there are issues and electorates like Curtin and others who want serious action on climate change or who want a national anti-corruption commission or who want people to be safe and to be treated properly. This government, the selection, Scott Morrison can’t say that he wants to form government in his own right. Because that is not going to happen. That is not the case. On the topic of Russian diplomats, Daniel Hurst has some more details: The Labor senator Penny Wong has been exploring the option of expelling Russian diplomats from Australia at the Senate estimates hearing. Overnight, Wong and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, have called on the Australian government to respond to alleged war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine by expelling diplomats. Wong said the “documented massacre and human rights abuses in Bucha” created “a new level of gravity of behaviour”. Officials confirmed that Russia had indicated it would take retaliatory actions against European countries that expelled Russian diplomats this week, but had not yet done so. Dfat’s secretary, Kathryn Campbell, said Australia had not ruled out expelling diplomats: I think the government has been clear that that remains an option. Campbell said Australia was working closely with its partners. She noted that the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, was in Brussels at the moment and able to “explore likely actions from likeminded countries”. Campbell also noted there were about 2,500 Australians living in Russia (a hint of one of the concerns officials may have about the impact of escalating diplomatic actions). Wong said she understood the need for caution before moving to expulsions, and she understood the argument for lines of communication: But there must be a line where a country so demonstrates its inability to adhere to international norms that those considerations are outweighed by the need to demonstrate even more strongly there are diplomatic costs. Jonathon Duniam, the senator representing Payne at the estimates hearing, said the government was taking measured and appropriate actions: Nothing is off the table and remain under active consideration. Anthony Albanese says he is not suggesting that Australia expel the Russian ambassador over the invasion of Ukraine, only a number of other diplomats. Reporter: You previously have been in lockstep of the government when it comes to Ukraine but now you are calling for Russia republic diplomats to be kicked out. How come? Are you suggesting the government is soft on Russia? Albanese: No, I am not suggesting that at all. What I suggesting is that the government should consider what countries like France and Italy and others in Europe have done, which is to expel in response to the outrageous atrocities that are being committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. We have war crimes being committed. We have civilians being murdered. We have rape being used as a weapon of war. We need to send a strong message to Russia along with our allies in Europe that have made this decision … We haven’t suggested the expulsion of the Russian ambassador to Australia. What we have suggested is we join with other likeminded countries in sending a very strong message to Russia. We make that suggestion to the government. We have been very supportive of the measures the government had made up to this point in time. But with the information and escalation that has occurred from Russia, it is very clear that Vladimir Putin doesn’t seem to be getting the message from the rest of the world. The rest of the world are all saying, Australians are united in their opposition to the intervention in Ukraine. It is important we continue to send the strongest possible message and one way we could do that is expulsion of some diplomats. WA premier Mark McGowan has started his speech at this press conference by announcing the state’s daily Covid numbers: Till 8pm last night we were reporting 7,998 new cases, just under 8,000 new cases. Of these, 3,255 were confirmed through PCR and 4743 were confirmed through Rat tests. I think that shows the value of our free Rat program in WA. There were 256 cases in hospital, which is a slight reduction. We had over 15,000 PCR tests yesterday. There were no deaths recorded yesterday but there will be three deaths reported – they are people who passed away the last few weeks with Covid. That will be reported today. OK, why don’t we jump over to Anthony Albanese now, who is speaking from Perth today and, by gosh! He is finally joined by the man of the hour, WA premier Mark McGowan! Seems that all it took was the promise of a level crossing removal if elected. Anthony Albanese: Today’s announcement is a good one. It is about busting congestion, it is about improving road safety. This level crossing here closes 266 times each and every day. What that does is hold up traffic and, also, it is a safety issue as cars that are heading in the direction all of a sudden have to stop here each and every day. What we want to look for is to partner with Western Australia in projects that will improve productivity, improve road safety, and make a difference to people’s lives. This project here which will be jointly funded by a federal Labor government that I lead to get up with Mark McGowan’s Labor government in WA will make an enormous difference to the growing community. I thank Matt for his advocacy in this project. These bells ringing that we are hearing now, 266 times every single day, can be stopped, they can be stopped by this investment and is an advertisement that federal Labor and the state Labor government will join to deliver making a difference, creating jobs as well. Scott Morrison has launched an offensive against the Queensland state government over flood relief funding, claiming that the state has not been delivering flood funding into the pockets of affected communities: These requests are still out of scope of the normal project that are done under this program. It was, I think, a very reasonable position for us to expect the state government to fund things that they should be funding. But what was very clear from the state government’s response is they were not prepared to do that. And I am not going to have people left in the lurch as a result of the Queensland state government playing politics on the eve of an election, trying to weaponise, politically, the flood experiences of Queenslanders. So we will make it happen. I don’t think people want to see fights between state and federal government – state government has sought to make an issue out of this so I want to make sure the support flows. I put some conditions on it. The Queensland government still hasn’t spent $52m from the support we have given them for past natural disasters. They haven’t been spending the money that we have said to them to help people … They sat on the money in their bank account. They haven’t even spent the money we have said them for past disasters, you can understand the federal government would be cautious about the request that are now being made. The condition of this funding going forward is the state government in Queensland – and other states, for that matter – we’ll need to be transparent about how much money is getting paid through. I am not talking about over a number of years. The Queensland government today should be very clear about how much of the $550m program that we already committed to in the first wave, how much of that specifically how they got to small businesses? How much have they got to primary producers and community organisations? How many cheques have they actually written? … We will be providing those funds once it has been dispersed and settling up with the Queensland government. It is important they are transparent with Queenslanders, just as New South Wales seeks to do here, with how much money from that flood response is actually getting to people now. Queensland treasurer Cameron Dick has accused Scott Morrison of being “too slow to act” on flood relief: It is regrettable that it took so long for the prime minister to act. It took him three weeks to consider our proposal. In 36 hours after the prime minister said no, he’s now said yes ... This should not be the matter of whether there’s an election or not, this should be a matter of government business. Morrison backflipped on the $741m disaster relief package this morning, announcing the federal government would split the costs. Dick said he welcomed the funding but it was “nonsense” that the prime minister had called for greater transparency on the delivery of the disaster funding: That’s just nonsense by the prime minister. The Queensland’s Reconstruction Authority is responsible … for all resilience payments ... Currently, he’s got two advisers on the board … he knows exactly what we do with the money. The prime minister is too late to the ball again. Local MP Milton Dick said the funding would help build homes in a more resilient fashion: That might be raising the home or designing them to be more flood-resilient … for some people, they may wish to relocate. Conditions seem to be worsening in the Picton CBD, with a number of residents ordered to evacuate. The prime minister has been asked about his (somewhat disastrous) visit to a local pub last night, where he was confronted by a pensioner demanding answers about previous election promises. Reporter: A frosty reception at the Edgeworth Tavern last night, are you frustrated to see that? Scott Morrison: It was actually a very welcome reception. There was one gentleman, Ray, who was very upset about a complicated case, it was involving Medicare and immigration issues. It was also involving income definitions under the pension regime. He has had a lot of complications with those cases. And my staff met with him also, after I carefully listened to what he had to say and respectfully listened to what he had to say. He was not asked to [leave or] anything like that. I can understand that he was very upset about some very significant issues that had happened his life. And so I was keen to understand what he was saying to me and I believe we have. It is a complicated case but we will see how we might be able to assist and progress that. As you move around, I like hearing from people. I hear from people all the time. While some may have some very complex issues that need to be addressed, others, I must say you were there last night, it was great to see them. Reporter: People are still waiting for the Central Coast promises from the last election. What certainty can you give that Central Coast residents will have an upgrade delivered on time? Scott Morrison: We have already acquired the land here and you will be aware of the challenges we have had in Gosford because of the issues that have occurred with the Gosford city council. It disrupted our ability to move forward on that project. I think people would understand that. These projects were talking about here, you heard very clearly, the state government is fully onboard with both these projects and I am very confident they will understand the great value in the faster rail project, as Sam just outlined. Money is in the budget, it’s all they are to be done, a partnership with the state government to make that happen. There were some challenges with a couple of those projects but they are important projects. We want to get them done. Scott Morrison: Here are, what we are seeing is a town becoming a hub in the Central Coast. Where people are not driving through, they are staying, they are residing, they are running businesses, they have a future here … That needs the infrastructure to support it and that is why I am pleased to announce, it is in the budget, $1.1bn to go to three very important projects. The first of those is the upgrade of the Central Coast Highway. That is $52m, $51.2m that we are putting into the $65m project. Together with the state government – we are funding 80%, they are funding 20%. That work will get under way this year and it is an important part of clearing along the Central Coast as more people are living here. Scott Morrison is in the Central Coast today, talking about all the development and infrastructure work which is going to build up regional communities. (While elsewhere in NSW, regional infrastructure is being destroyed by devastating floods and extreme weather connected to the climate crisis.) Morrison: This is an important day. Australia is not just the eight capital cities of this country. That is something my government firmly believes, the Liberal/ National government is about ensuring our regions and rural areas and remote communities are understood and are supported. So much of the opportunities in Australia are actually outside our major capital cities. That has always been true in the Central Coast and it’s important that in the Central Coast, where more and more people every year are choosing to live … they need this infrastructure that supports quality of life and also support their economic opportunities. We have further increased the size of our infrastructure pipeline to make sure that we can be supporting regional communities all around the country with the infrastructure and services and, most importantly, the jobs that make those communities work. Scott Morrison is speaking now. Let’s have a listen in. Sydney and surrounding areas have been battered by severe storms this morning, with up to 140mm of rain forecast over six hours. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning just before 5am, predicting rainfall of between 60mm and 100mm would fall over a wide stretch of the already sodden state, including Sydney, the Illawarra, the south coast, the central and southern tablelands, and parts of the Hunter. On the coast, rainfall could reach up to 140mm, the BoM said. A flash-flooding warning was issued for coastal parts of the south coast, the Illawarra, metropolitan Sydney and the southern Hunter region, extending into the southern and central tablelands in the afternoon. You can read the full report below: In some excellent news, the man reported to be swept away in flood waters in the Epping area has been found safe and well, the ABC reports. A spokesperson for the NSW SES has confirmed that a rescue operation is under way after the service received reports about 9.14am that a man had been spent away in floodwaters in the Epping area of Sydney. She says the SES is working with NSW police. The ABC is reporting that a man has been swept away in flood waters in Epping, north-west Sydney. I’ll bring you more updates as soon as I can. Scientists have developed a blood test that can predict whether someone is at high risk of a heart attack, stroke, heart failure or dying from one of these conditions within the next four years. The test, which relies of measurements of proteins in the blood, has roughly twice the accuracy of existing risk scores. It could enable doctors to determine whether patients’ existing medications are working or whether they need additional drugs to reduce their risk. Dr Stephen Williams at SomaLogic in Boulder, Colorado, led the research. He said: I think this is the new frontier of personalised medicine, to be able to answer the question, does this person need enhanced treatment? And when you’ve treated someone, did it actually work? You can read the full report below: The Australian government has confirmed that two Australian intelligence chiefs have flown to Solomon Islands for talks with the prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, amid concerns in Canberra about the country’s proposed security agreement with China. The ABC – which first reported the travel – noted that Sogavare’s office had posted a picture of the prime minister with Andrew Shearer, the head of the Office of National Intelligence, and Paul Symon, who leads the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. At a Senate estimates hearing this morning, the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Kathryn Campbell, confirmed both directors general had been at the meeting in Honiara: DG ONI and DG ASIS did meet with the prime minister of the Solomon Islands. Campbell said Australia’s high commissioner to Solomon Islands, Lachlan Strahan, was also in attendance. Campbell did not dispute reports that the meeting included discussion of Australia’s security concerns about the security agreement. I think the media has outlined what was the substance of that meeting. This is not uncommon for these office holders to engage in the region. Campbell said Ewen McDonald, the head of the office of the Pacific at Dfat, had also travelled to Honiara last Sunday: Mr McDonald is in the Solomon Islands and raising these matters. He will return to Australia Friday. He is continuing to work with the Solomon Islands government on these matters. The Senate estimates hearing was told Australia was continuing to call for transparency about the prospective deal with China. There is no clarity on when it might be signed, and any updated form of words since the draft leaked two weeks ago. Australia’s foreign affairs minister Marise Payne is in Brussels today, meeting with Nato members to discuss the situation in Ukraine. But, from the sounds of the US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s statement, there are other topics *cough* the looming security pack between China and the Solomon Islands *cough* too. Here’s what his spokesperson said: The Secretary and the Foreign Minister reiterated their commitment to ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and noted the April 4 release of the AUKUS Leaders’ Statement, summarizing the progress AUKUS partners have made over the past six months. They also shared concerns about recent regional developments and ways to support countries in making open and transparent decisions about their own security and economic interests. A little win for Victoria this morning: Two days after the commonwealth rejected the bulk of Queensland’s proposed multimillion-dollar flood recovery package, Scott Morrison has had a change of heart. The $741m plan now appears likely to proceed but the prime minister warns there are caveats to the federal government agreeing to split the cost, AAP reports. He told Brisbane radio 4BC this morning: They want to play politics with this, I don’t want to play politics with this, I just want to make sure people are getting the support that they need. So we’ll make that the 50-50 cost but there’ll be a couple of conditions. The Queensland government was sitting on $52m provided for previous disaster recovery, Morrison said: I want them to be transparent with the payments that are being made. I want them to report to the public. He maintained that the bulk of the $741m package, which includes funding for flood-proofing homes and a property buyback program, is typically a state responsibility. The latest commitment meant two-thirds of direct financial support for Queensland flood victims was coming from the commonwealth, he said. His comments came just a day after acting premier Cameron Dick took aim at him, also claiming that politics was the reason the state’s request was initially refused. Dick rejected claims that most of the package included initiatives that were a state responsibility, saying it was an exceptional circumstances application under disaster recovery arrangements: If the prime minister doesn’t see that something’s happening in the world, and we need to make our communities more disaster-resilient ... then he’s not paying attention. The man seeking a high court challenge against federal intervention in NSW Liberal preselections has been expelled from the party. In an escalation of the factional stoush, Matthew Camenzuli has asked the high court to prevent Scott Morrison’s hand-picked candidates from receiving Liberal endorsement on ballot papers pending the urgent case. Camenzuli yesterday sought leave to appeal against the NSW court of appeal’s decision to uphold the federal party’s intervention, which allowed a three-person panel, including Morrison, to select 13 candidates for the May election. You can read the full report from Paul Karp and Anne Davies below: Anthony Albanese has called on the government to expel Russian diplomats, declaring that the “sickening abuses being carried out by Russian forces” in Ukraine must trigger immediate consequences. In a pre-election attempt to get on the front foot on national security, the Labor leader said Scott Morrison must act in lockstep with European partners by ordering a number of Russian diplomats and staff to leave. Under the model suggested by Albanese, the Russian ambassador, Alexey Pavlovsky, would probably be able to remain in place, but some of his subordinates would be declared “persona non grata”, forcing them to depart the country. You can read the full report below: A rain update for Sydney so far this year: The acting Queensland premier, Cameron Dick, has told ABC radio that it is “blatantly untrue” that the federal government isn’t responsible for flood recovery in affected areas: If the prime minister doesn’t think it’s his responsibility, he should go to Grantham. We built a new community, the federal government, together we relocated 200 families out of a flood site ... There’s been precedent multiple precedents for over more than a decade now ... There are agreed funding arrangements between state and federal governments that have existed for more than a decade now ... And just to give you an idea of what we want to do, as you’ve said, you know, it’s raising houses, it’s making houses stronger and more resilient. Julia Gillard could do her job. Malcolm Turnbull could do his job. Even Tony Abbott could do his job when it comes to this. The prime minister has got to do his job and stop shifting responsibility on to other people. The deluge has already begun in some areas of NSW this morning. Here is some harrowing footage from Dee Why. Just a reminder that you should never ever attempt to drive through flood waters. Oh, and it didn’t get much better for the prime minister after that. Scott Morrison certainly isn’t the only one to wake up and wish they never stepped foot in the pub last night, but instead of nursing a headache the prime minister has been left red in the face. Last night he stopped in for a pre-election visit to the Edgeworth Tavern in Newcastle. But the photo opp took a turn for the worse when an irate man came up to him, pointing his finger and demanding answers about what is being done to fulfil previous election promises for pensioners: I’ve been fighting for 12 years, mate – you treat a disability pensioner that worked all his life … he paid his taxes, now he’s getting taxed ahead ... This is what you said when you got elected last time, “We’re going to help all those people that worked all their lives, paid their taxes and those that have a go, get a go.” Well, I’ve had a go, mate, I’ve worked all my life and paid my taxes. Have a watch below: Good morning, all, it’s Matilda Boseley here with you on the blog this morning. First on the agenda, many in NSW are bracing for another day of wild weather, with flood warnings issued for multiple river catchments across the state. A severe weather warning is in place for southern and central NSW, metropolitan Sydney, the Illawarra, the south coast, the central and southern tablelands and parts of the Hunter. The Bureau of Meteorology warned there’s also an increased risk of landslides. Roads in the Sydney suburb of Kurnell have been urgently closed this morning after a failed pump at a fuel refinery has caused oil and diesel to mix with flood waters and spread across roadways. A flood watch has also been issued for central NSW, with minor to moderate flooding forecast for the southern coastal rivers including the Hawkesbury-Nepean, the Macquarie and Queanbeyan today and tomorrow. This morning the NSW SES warned there could be major flooding in Liverpool and Milperra in Sydney’s west along the Georges River with the water expected to rise above four metres in the late afternoon on the high tide. Minor flood warnings have been issued for the Hawkesbury River at Windsor and North Richmond and the Cooks River at Tempe Bridge and the Woronora River at Woronora Bridge. Moderate flooding could also occur on the Colo River at Putty Road. The SES said it had conducted seven flood rescues and responded to 580 requests for help in the past 24 hours. OK, with that, why don’t we jump right into the day."

AD Reader’s choice Last week, we highlighted five of the best podcasts about women, and asked for your suggestions. Here is one from reader Bella Black: The Receipts podcast makes me howl with laughter. I love that its hosted by these three agony aunts/friends [Tolani Shoneye AKA Tolly T, Milena Sanchez and Audrey Indome] who have such a close bond. The titles are almost as good as the episodes, too – who wouldn’t be intrigued by “my dad is being catfished”?! There’s a podcast for that This week, Ammar Kalia chooses the best audio dramas for scripted podcast fans, from spooky small-town goings-on to a historical blockbuster starring Rosamund Pike Edith Scripted dramas can often seem like an excuse for audio production companies to stuff their new releases with celebrity names, rather than strong ideas and robust scriptwriting. Podcast network QCode has become something of a specialist in this celeb audio drama industry – with mixed results – but Edith, released last year, is one of their finest offerings, its high-profile casting matching the grandiosity of the script. Starring Rosamund Pike as Edith Wilson, the series recounts how she secretly took over from her incapacitated husband, US President Woodrow Wilson, in 1919 after he suffered a stroke. Mixing high stakes with farce – and a delightful American accent from Pike – the result is a wry take on the historical machinations of power. Welcome to Night Vale Arguably the first massively popular scripted drama podcast to kick the entire craze off, this fictional radio show reporting on the eerie goings-on in a small US town kicked off in 2012 and has since run to over 200 episodes. Following in the footsteps of other early scripted podcast hits like Limetown, a TV adaptation is also currently in the works, while new episodes of the podcast are available twice a month. Start with episode 13 – a meta-narrative which takes you, the listener, as its mysterious subject. 36 Questions This three-part 2017 creation from Chris Littler and Ellen Winter is a delightfully experimental journey into an estranged couple’s faltering relationship, told through song. Spring Awakening’s Jonathan Groff and Jessie Shelton star as the pair, trying to reconnect through 36 Questions That Lead to Love: a psychological survey designed to encourage intimacy. The couple record themselves in the form of a confessional, creating a tightly structured narrative that is delivered with gusto by Groff and Shelton. The 13 songs in 36 Questions prove that podcasting has ample scrope to explore and play with musical conventions. Here Lies Me For fans of coming-of-age teenage tales like Pen15 and Big Mouth, writer Hillary Frank’s 2021 podcast Here Lies Me is essential listening. Tackling the particularly thorny age of eighth grade (13 to 14 years old), Frank’s YA narrative follows 13-year-old Noa as she navigates crushes, rivalries and changing friendships. Here Lies Me’s strengths lie in the casting of actual teenagers in its various roles – particularly Ollie Grishaber as Noa – as well as Frank’s willingness not to shy away from difficult topics such as sexual consent and racism. Moonface With shades of writer Ocean Vuong’s poetic realism, James Kim’s emotively nuanced 2019 series tells the story of Korean American Paul (Joel Kim Booster) and his attempts to come out to his mother, despite the fact that her English is shaky and his Korean is minimal. Concerned with the frictions of misunderstanding as much as it is with meaning, Kim’s script harnesses the silences between words throughout its brisk six episodes. Rather than relying on polished scripts, Moonface gives us a taste of authentically strained communication between a mother and son, and a listening experience that is quietly thought-provoking.

Angus Taylor in pre-election move to make coal plants give five years’ notice before closing,2022-04-07T08:36:03Z,Adam Morton Climate and environment editor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ntg,"Owners of ageing coal-fired power plants would be required to give at least five years’ notice before shutting under a last-minute rule change proposed by Angus Taylor shortly before the federal election is expected to be called. Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, said on Thursday he had written to the Australian Electricity Market Commission asking it to extend the notice period for generators to shut from 3.5 to five years to “safeguard the delivery of affordable, reliable power for consumers”. The proposal was backed by the New South Wales government, but electricity generators and analysts questioned whether it was necessary and suggested it would make little difference if a coal plant was failing or its owner was broke. The proposal, which will now be subject to a formal commission process including two rounds of public submissions, follows announcements that coal plants would close earlier than scheduled as they increasingly struggle to compete with cheaper renewable energy. In the most recent example, Origin Energy announced in February the country’s largest coal-fired power plant, the Eraring station on the shore of Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, would close in 2025, seven years earlier than previously planned. Taylor was not told of Origin’s decision until the night before its announcement. On Thursday, he said the notice period extension was a “critical reform” to ensure the energy industry had enough time to build new generation capacity to replace closing plants. Tristan Edis, from the consultants Green Energy Markets, said the decision made little sense. He said it was already possible to build batteries to replace coal plants in much less than 3.5 years, and he doubted a five-year notice period would be enforceable if there was an early closure due to a plant suffering a catastrophic failure or if the owner became financially unviable. “In those circumstances, how can you make them?” he said. Sarah McNamara, chief executive of the Australian Energy Council, which represents generators, questioned whether the change was needed. She said it could be counterproductive if it forced a company to publish a closure date long before the plant’s operational circumstances were clear. “It should be recognised that generators, like any business operation, are subject to many unknowns and risks that such a rule cannot address. For example, plants may have physical failures or may be required to unexpectedly cease operations due to health and safety or environmental regulations. Company directors also have obligations under the [Corporations Act] in relation to operations that have become unexpectedly uneconomic,” she said. “All of these issues would limit the effectiveness of such a rule.” Taylor was sharply critical of Origin’s announcement in February that it could shut Eraring, a 2,880MW black coal generator, from August 2025. The company said its decision reflected “the rapidly changing conditions in the national electricity market, which are increasingly not well suited to traditional baseload power stations”. It followed AGL announcing it would bring forward the closure of the Bayswater generator in NSW from 2035 to no later than 2033, and its brown coal-fired Loy Yang A plant in Victoria from 2048 to 2045. EnergyAustralia’s Yallourn power plant, also in the Latrobe Valley, will shut in 2028 rather than 2032. The early closure announcements have been prompted by the rapid rise of cheaper renewable energy, which reached more than 30% of grid generation last year and is forecast to hit at least 69% by 2030. At the time, the Australian Energy Market Operator’s chief executive, Daniel Westerman, said NSW would have access to enough electricity generation when Eraring closed due to planned additional capacity, including new transmission and a new battery announced by the state government. On Thursday, the NSW treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, said he welcomed Taylor’s proposal. “Building the new electricity infrastructure like pumped hydro and renewable energy zones needed to replace retiring power stations takes many years, and it is important that investors have as much notice as possible to develop these projects,” he said. But Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, suggested Taylor had made a “knee-jerk” request for a rule change after being left out of negotiations between Origin and the NSW government over Eraring’s closure. “It is abundantly clear that coal plants are going to accelerate their closures, closing faster than their official retirement dates. If this government was genuine about providing certainty to coal communities, it would develop a national coal closure roadmap rather than attempting to strong-arm coal plants one by one,” he said. “Failure to develop a coal closure roadmap leaves workers and communities without support or a plan for the future.” Through a spokesperson, federal Labor’s climate change and energy shadow minister, Chris Bowen, said “the AEMC sets the rules on these matters and we’ll continue to follow their advice”. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the minor party would push the next government to close all coal plants by 2030. “More coal means more devastating floods and bushfires,” he said. “With the Liberals keeping coal for longer and Labor vowing they won’t close coal fired power stations early, we’re heading for the climate cliff.”"
Australian Human Rights Commission’s status at risk over Coalition’s appointment process,2022-04-07T08:33:58Z,Paul Karp,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nvv,"Australia’s Human Rights Commission risks having its global accreditation downgraded because of the way the Coalition made key appointments. It is claimed the government bypassed open merit-based selection processes for the appointment of Lorraine Finlay as human rights commissioner in 2021 and Ben Gauntlett as disability discrimination commissioner in 2019. These appointments were cited as concerns in a decision to defer the commission’s accreditation as an A-status institution. The decision by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions reflects feedback over a 10-year period from the commission, which itself concedes “three appointments in this timeframe did not meet the accreditation requirements”. The third was the appointment of former human rights commissioner, now Liberal MP, Tim Wilson in 2013 by the Abbott government. The decision by the global alliance, a partner of the United Nations, noted the commission’s rules allow the attorney-general to determine that a full selection process is not required where the appointment is considered urgent, as in Gauntlett’s case, or the candidate so eminent there would be “little value” in an open process, as in Finlay’s. It noted the attorney-general has written to the commission advising that future appointments would be openly advertised. “However, [GANHRI] is not satisfied that the commitment … is sufficient to indicate that full compliance with the Paris principles standards on selection and appointment will be forthcoming, either in terms of amendments to the existing process or future appointments in practice.” The body also noted the commission’s budget concerns, which have resulted in one in three jobs being slashed. The Human Rights Law Centre’s executive director, Hugh de Kretser, said: “The Morrison government has undermined the independence and effectiveness of the commission, making appointments without a public, merit-based selection process. “The Morrison government’s actions have jeopardised our national human rights watchdog at a critical time for human rights, both at home and globally. “Australia can and should lead the world on human rights. Instead of leading, the Morrison government is embarrassing us on the world stage.” Labor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, said the development was “very deeply concerning”. “We are a country that has a strong international reputation on human rights,” she told ABC News. “We should not allow that to be eroded.” A final decision on accreditation is expected by October 2023. The commission acknowledged it was “at risk of being downgraded to a B-status … if this issue is not sufficiently addressed within this timeframe”. This is the first time the commission has been at risk of losing its A-status since international standards for national human rights institutions were introduced in 1993. The commission said its president, Rosalind Croucher, has “shared with the government the commission’s concerns over the implications of the deferral and potential risks to the promotion and protection of human rights in Australia, as well as Australia’s reputation internationally”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The AHRC said it continues to advocate for changes to guarantee “open, transparent and merit-based” appointment processes, including advertising jobs. Finlay’s appointment was fiercely criticised by then Australian of the Year, Grace Tame, due to Finlay’s concern about affirmative consent laws, while other critics pointed to her Liberal party links, her outspoken views on an Indigenous voice to parliament, and section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Labor’s shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher told reporters in Canberra that “we have seen and are seeing in the dying days of this government appointments to key positions which affect trust in organisations”. On Monday the Morrison government appointed six people with Liberal links to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, among 19 appointments. Those, and separate jobs for former federal minister John McVeigh and NSW minister Don Harwin, have sparked concerns of a repeat of 2019, when a Guardian Australia analysis found that one in five of those appointed to government bodies in the fortnight before the election was called had Liberal or National party links."
"Australia’s Covid response should be examined by royal commission, Senate inquiry recommends",2022-04-07T08:32:45Z,Paul Karp,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nfy,"Australia needs a royal commission into the Covid response and should consider new laws to crack down on medical misinformation, the Senate’s Covid committee has recommended. In its final report, released on Thursday, the Labor-chaired committee called for greater transparency, including releasing decisions of Australia’s health advisers and the secretive national Covid commission, which called for a gas-led economic recovery. The report found that although “Australia fared much better than other countries” in the first wave of the pandemic, “significant failures” had caused “catastrophic consequences” including more than 6,000 deaths, about 30% in aged care. “This failure to establish stand-alone quarantine facilities resulted in overseas arrival caps being imposed, which severely restricted the number of people able to return to Australia, denying thousands of citizens entry to their own country,” it said. The vaccine rollout “was plagued by the failure to secure enough supply and significant delays which led to every target the government set itself being missed”. “The government has also failed to address the serious and dangerous vaccine misinformation promoted within the government’s own parliamentary ranks.” The committee called for the establishment of a Centre for Disease Control and for the federal government to intervene in the aged care work value case in support of pay rises in the sector – which are both Labor policies. It called for a review of the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s powers “to address health misinformation during public health campaigns or emergency responses”. The committee called for all national Covid commission reports to be made public, including “all declarations of actual and perceived conflicts of interest made by commissioners”; and “all previous and future minutes of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee”. It suggested a “royal commission be established to examine Australia’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic”, in line with calls started by independent senator Rex Patrick and supported by a number of Labor, crossbench and even Coalition senators. Katy Gallagher, the committee’s chair, told reporters in Canberra the royal commission was warranted because the committee had been “prevented” from accessing crucial information. That included national cabinet documents, which the Morrison government claims are cabinet in confidence. Gallagher did not commit Labor, if elected, to setting up a Covid royal commission, noting the Senate report was not opposition policy. When asked about the former Liberal prime minister Tony Abbott’s call for a royal commission in August, Morrison said he would not be “drawn into those things” because “we’re managing the pandemic right now, and this pandemic still has quite a long way to go”. “So I’m sure at some time in the future there’ll be a time to talk about those reviews or whatever form they might take,” he said. On Thursday Gallagher said that Australia was “unprepared” for the pandemic and the federal government “didn’t jump at taking responsibility”. She cited the Morrison government’s failures on “quarantine and vaccines”, which had caused “flow-on consequences”. “We think some of the failures have lengthened the lockdowns, we’ve had significant outbreaks as a result – obviously more cases, and unfortunately more deaths.” In a dissenting report, the Coalition senators said the Australian government had “delivered one of the lowest rates of loss of life and one of the strongest economic recoveries in the world”. Although it started as a bipartisan initiative, Coalition senators said the committee had become “a vehicle in which Labor senators have pursued partisan attacks on the government”. There had been a “remarkably high degree of government cooperation with this committee”, they said."
"Cuddly toy reviews being used to boost headphones on Amazon, says Which?",2022-04-07T08:28:49Z,Kevin Rawlinson,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ntm,"Amazon sellers have been artificially boosting their products’ influential customer ratings by co-opting positive reviews of unrelated items, a leading consumer magazine has reported. Which? said nine of the 10 highest-rated headphones on Amazon were carrying glowing reviews that were actually for products such as cuddly toys, jigsaw puzzles and umbrellas. They included two that carried the “Amazon’s choice” mark of approval. Which? said the nine were little-known brands, while just one established mark – Bose, which was rated eighth – did not show any signs of review abuse. “Unscrupulous businesses are exploiting weaknesses with Amazon’s review system, leaving shoppers at risk of buying products boosted by thousands of bogus five-star reviews,” said Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at Which?. The magazine said its study found that the most highly rated headphones available, which had five stars and were marked “Amazon’s choice”, had 40 reviews, none of which referred to headphones. “All of the reviews, including three reviews clearly showing photos of the product, were for ‘plushie’ toys – a ‘cute’ cuddly stuffed animal apparently loved by children and adults alike,” Which? reported. The practice is referred to as merging reviews. Online sellers can legitimately adopt it to gather all reviews for closely related products – such as differing colours of the same model – in one place. But Which? reported that merging reviews for unrelated products was against Amazon’s terms and conditions. Which? said it “focused its investigation on just one popular product category, but has also seen the issue across other categories, including smartphone chargers with reviews for surge protectors, tweezers boosted by reviews for non-stick kitchen foil, and blackhead removing nose strips boosted by reviews for wigs”. Concha said: “Once again, this reinforces the importance of the CMA’s ongoing fake reviews investigation getting to the bottom of the issue and ensuring that major shopping sites are protecting people from these unfair practices. “The government also announced its intention to tackle fake reviews as part of its consumer and competition reforms and should bring forward new laws, in the upcoming Queen’s speech, to banish these exploitative practices as soon as possible.” An Amazon spokesperson told the BBC: “We have now taken appropriate enforcement action against the product listings and sellers in question. “We have clear guardrails in place to prevent products from being incorrectly grouped, either due to human error or abuse. “Our proactive measures detect and block the vast majority of abuse in our store automatically: however, we are disappointed when bad actors evade our system and we will continue to innovate and invest in our tools and processes.”"
French election polls: who is leading the race to be the next president of France?,2022-04-01T13:41:52Z,Angelique Chrisafis and Seán Clarke,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y6ndg,"France will vote to elect a new president on April 10, and the final list of candidates consists of twelve competitors, chief among them the Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. The current president, Emmanuel Macron, declared last month that he intends to run for a second term. His second-round opponent from 2017, the far-right Marine Le Pen, had already launched her campaign. The hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon is currently polling in third place. The right’s Valérie Pécresse, standing for Les Républicains, is vying with the far-right former TV pundit, Eric Zemmour, for fourth place. They are followed in the polls by the Green’s Yannick Jadot, the Communist party’s Fabien Roussel and the Socialist candidate and mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo. Would-be candidates had until 4 March to present the 500 signatures of elected officials supporting their run, which the law requires. A first round is to be held on 10 April, and in the likely event that no candidate receives a majority of the votes, a second round runoff will be held two weeks later, featuring the two leading candidates from the first round. Polls suggest that the run-off will probably put Macron up against Le Pen, in a re-run of the second round in 2017. • This article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation as well as possible.

"Mussel soup, asparagus spaghetti and slow-roast lamb: Joe Trivelli’s Italian Easter recipes",2022-04-07T08:00:08Z,Joe Trivelli,https://www.theguardian.com/p/kpqvm,"The life of a chef has many advantages but routine is not one of them. Easter at home offers the perfect excuse for the sort of Sunday lunch I wish we had every week. A feast embedded in ritual and tradition. Before I had family of my own, the Easter table was a gathering of friends and cousins. I made the hearty northern Italian food of Emilia-Romagna where my aunt Dina lives. In Parma, the first signs of spring mean earliest pea and bean pods and delicate young stalks of asparagus. Things are more of a gamble in the UK, but I’m always hopeful spring will come early and our farm box will contain some jewels nestled among the roots. I have a weekend of celebration in mind: a Neapolitan mussel soup traditionally eaten on Maundy Thursday; the fish that would appear on Good Friday, given a twist in its punchy oily bath. You can’t have Easter without eggs, and I’ve ticked that box with an egg-rich, creamy pasta with fine strands of shaved asparagus that my wife devoured in an exhausted heap, clamouring for bread to mop up the spectacular sauce. That’s Saturday night sorted. Lamb cooked in pecorino is for Easter Sunday, with chunks of potato that make it feel almost like a hotpot. It’s a rich little number and we have a lamb’s lettuce salad alongside. Everyone has seconds. Mussel soup with friselle (pictured above) In Naples this soup is eaten on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday, with the addition of octopus. Friselle, a type of very hard, biscuited bread roll that resembles an open bagel, are not hard to make if you have a little time and fancy a baking project, but it’s also not that hard to find them for sale in Italian shops or online. A baguette sliced and toasted in the oven is a perfect alternative. If you make your own friselle, allow them to dry properly and the extra will keep until tomatoes are ripe in the summer. Dampen the hard bread with a little water, before topping them with the classic; fresh tomatoes, basil, garlic and olive oil. Serves 4 For the soup mussels 1.8kg olive oil garlic 2 cloves dried red chilli 1, or chilli oil parsley a small bunch tinned plum tomatoes 300g, drained and diced sea salt For the friselle (makes 10) durum wheat semolina flour 250g whole wheat flour 250g dried yeast 1 tsp water 300ml sea salt 10g To make the friselle, mix 50g of each of the flours with the yeast and 100ml of the water at a tepid temperature. Stir and allow to stand somewhere warmish for 1½ hours, until doubled and bubbly. Mix in the rest of the flour with the salt and the other 200ml of water. Knead either in the bowl of a mixer with a dough hook or by hand for about 8 minutes, until the softish dough is much more elastic and smooth. Cover and allow to rise again for another hour or two until well risen. Cut the dough into 5 equal pieces and roll into balls. Set apart on baking paper lightly dusted with extra flour. Cover with a towel and set aside for another 30 minutes. Use your thumbs to gently open the rolls in the centre to create doughnuts. Set aside for another hour. Heat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn the oven down to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Remove from the oven and, using a cloth in one hand to protect you from the hot rolls, cut them in half laterally. Return the halves to the baking sheet cut side up and bake for another 25-30 minutes. They will be toasty around the edges and the centre will have very slightly sunk. Once cooled they should be hard and will keep very well, so you’ll have extras. For the soup, I like to clean the mussels as soon as I get back from the shops, so they have a while to soak. Clean the shells, strip the beards and give them a rinse, then place in highly sea-salted cold water in the fridge for several hours, even overnight. This purifies them and makes them juicier. Heat a heavy saucepan with a lid over a medium high heat. Add the drained mussels and a splash of fresh water. Cover, shake and cook until all the mussels are open, then empty into a bowl. Return the pan to the heat, add 4 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the garlic and chilli. When they are sizzling, but not too browned, add the parsley and, 1 minute later, the tomatoes. Cook briskly stirring often. The idea is to render the tomatoes to paste. It should take 10 minutes or so. Pick the meat from half the mussels. Pass the juice through a sieve if gritty, otherwise don’t bother. Pour everything into the tomato base and reheat. Put a frisella in each of four warm bowls and cover with the hot mussel liquid and top with the rest of the mussels. Make sure you use all the juice so that they are saturated. Allow to soak for a minute before eating. Lamb and pecorino This dish of tender strips of lamb sitting on soft potatoes is as indulgent as it is straightforward. I made this for friends and had time for a stroll to the brewery for refreshments while the lamb looked after itself. Serves 4 boneless breast of lamb 900g (unrolled if sold rolled as a joint) new potatoes 800g olive oil garlic 6 cloves, whole bay leaves 10 fresh red wine 200ml pecorino romano 50g, grated red wine vinegar 3 tbsp capers 1 tbsp Heat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Cut the lamb into strips about 3cm wide and season with salt. Slice the potatoes about 2cm thick. Heat a wide ovenproof pan with a lid over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and some of the lamb, skin side down. Allow the lamb to colour and contract as the fat begins to render. Cook for 5 minutes, until golden, then turn them over and do the other side. Remove to a plate and repeat with the rest of the meat. Pour off the fat and return the pan to a lower heat. Add the garlic and bay, fry for 3 minutes, then turn off the heat. Add the potatoes in one layer, the red wine and half of the cheese. Top with the lamb, a liberal grind of coarse black pepper, the red wine vinegar, the capers and the rest of the cheese. Cover, place in the oven and cook for 2 hours. When cooked, remove the lamb from the top and spoon off some of the grease to reveal the red wine pecorino juice beneath. Haddock, samphire, sundried tomatoes and olives This dish does use a lot of good olive oil, but it’s worthwhile and could not be easier to make. Use only a little salt when cooking the fish as the samphire will add some of its own. I leave chilli and pepper out because my olive oil is excessively peppery – feel free to add it, though, if you’d like to. You can swap the smoked haddock for whatever is in season, but make the recipe well ahead – preferably the day before – so the flavours mingle and the olive oil soaks in and brings everything together. We eat this as a starter with thickly sliced, warm wholemeal bread. Serves 4 as a starter sundried tomatoes 50g (the dry ones, not jarred) salted capers 1 tsp red wine vinegar 3 tbsp green olives 75g garlic 1 clove lemon peel 2 strips marsh samphire 100g lightly smoked undyed haddock fillet 250g, preferably pin boned, cut into 2 pieces olive oil 150ml Put the sundried tomatoes and capers in a bowl and cover with the red wine vinegar and 200ml of boiling water. Leave to reconstitute for a couple of hours. Squash the olives with your thumb on a board and remove the stones. Cut the garlic clove into paper thin slices. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to the boil with the lemon peel. Add the samphire, then, after a minute, the haddock. Turn the heat down to medium and cook for 2 minutes. Turn the heat off and leave for another minute or 2. Remove the fish with a slotted spoon. If it flakes, it is cooked – if not, return to the hot water. Once cooked, place it in a dish, carefully remove the skin and break into several pieces where it naturally flakes. Drain the samphire and add it to the fish with the drained tomatoes and capers, and the olives and garlic. Cover with olive oil while everything is still warm. Set aside overnight in the fridge until lunch the next day. Asparagus, anchovy, parmesan and egg spaghetti Cooking the asparagus with the pasta adds a lighter touch to an otherwise massively rich celebratory pasta. Serves 4 asparagus 500g onion 1 small olive oil anchovy fillets 8 sea salt spaghetti, linguini or bucatini 360g egg yolks 2 large parmesan 50g, grated black pepper Trim the ends of the asparagus, cut each spear in half and then into long strips. Slice the onion as finely as possible. In 3 tablespoons of olive oil, sweat the onion over a medium-low heat for 15 minutes, until translucent. Use a tablespoon of water to help if they start to fry. Add the anchovy fillets, stirring until they melt, then turn the heat off. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Cook the spaghetti for half the time stated on the packet, then add the asparagus to the water. Whisk the yolks well with the grated cheese, add a ladle of pasta-asparagus water and a generous grind of black pepper. Drain the pasta, reserving still more pasta water, then toss well with the anchovy sauce in the still warm pan but off the heat. When mixed, add the egg and continue to mix well. Use extra cooking water if you like it looser. Serve right away on hot plates. Pork and artichokes The lavender is pungent, strong and very much an optional extra. I’ve only recently rediscovered this flavour having had a bad early experience with lavender ice-cream. I love it, but if I didn’t have gnarled dry lavender in the front garden, I wouldn’t bother at this time of year. Serves 5 garlic 6 cloves juniper berries 8 fennel seeds 1 tsp lavender a sprig rosemary leaves 1 tbsp thyme leaves 2 tbsp sea salt 1½ tbsp sugar ½ tbsp pork neck 1.2kg, skin removed artichokes 10 medium lemons 2 parsley 4 sprigs, leaves picked breadcrumbs 50g celery 6 sticks onion 1 medium, sliced A day ahead, crush 2 of the garlic cloves in a pestle and mortar with the juniper and fennel seeds. Finely chop the lavender, rosemary and thyme, and add to the garlic with the sea salt and sugar. Mix, then rub it all over the pork and set aside, covered, in the fridge. The next day, tie the pork up with a piece of string in the middle and at the ends to hold it in a rounded joint shape. Bring to room temperature while you heat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7 and prepare the artichokes. Remove the toughest outer leaves of the artichokes, snapping or cutting them down with scissors. Trim around the base and stem with a small knife. Trim the stalk and the tips to remove the darkest part of the leaves. Rotate the artichokes upside down and press to open up the leaves a bit and carefully stretch them further with your fingers. Use a teaspoon to scoop out the choke. Rub each one all over with 1 of the lemons, cut in half, to stop them discolouring before you move on to the next. When all prepped, finely slice a garlic clove and stuff it between leaves of an artichoke with some parsley leaves, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper. Repeat with each one. Place a casserole on a medium-high heat with a tablespoon of olive oil and sear the pork all over, positioning its best-looking side up when you’re done. Turn the heat off, then surround the meat with the celery, any remaining garlic, the stuffed artichokes, onion, the juice of the remaining lemon and a splash of water. Cover with a piece of crumpled baking paper and bake for 1¼ hours, or until the pork is hot (above 64C) in the centre. Leave to rest somewhere warm before slicing and serving.

Metronome by Tom Watson review – fragile hopes of escape,2022-04-07T08:00:08Z,Nina Allan,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y4njk,"By taking the decision to have a child without obtaining official permission, Whitney and Aina are breaking the law. When their crime is discovered they become social outcasts, condemned to serve a 12-year sentence of exile on a remote island in the north. At the croft they must fend for themselves, learning the art of survival in a hostile landscape. They are aided in their endeavour by an annual drop of essential supplies, together with the hope that once the 12 years have passed, they may be allowed to return home. Their punishment is made harder by the fact that toxic spores from the melting permafrost have been released into the atmosphere; anyone spending time in that part of the world must take prophylactic pills at eight-hour intervals to stay alive. These are dispensed via an automated “pill clock”, activated by the thumb print of the designated user, keeping the miscreants effectively tethered to their place of exile. As Whitney and Aina near the end of their sentence, Whitney becomes ever more obsessed by the need to “prove loyal” in order to win parole. Aina, by contrast, has begun to suspect that this promise of freedom has been bogus all along. She is desperate to learn the fate of their son, Max, and fears her husband may be keeping this knowledge to himself. Dystopias in which the state has seized control of women’s bodies are everywhere, from Sophie Mackintosh’s Blue Ticket to Christina Dalcher’s Vox and Joanne Ramos’s The Farm. The influence of The Handmaid’s Tale is clear, though newer writers have not always been as skilful as Margaret Atwood in weaving a credible future from the stuff of now. In his debut novel, Tom Watson seems less interested in the wider political and social reality of his world than in the mundane detail of the characters’ lives and the bleakness of the landscape they inhabit, the emotional standoff that exists between them as a result of the traumatic severing of their previous existence. His use of language is nuanced and sensitive, with landscape writing especially a sensory highlight. His imagining of the sparse and chilly beauty of the island, together with the exiles’ thwarted attempts to make creative sense of both their fate and their surroundings, should make for an engrossing and memorable reading experience. But although the underlying mystery and sense of threat is enough to keep us engaged and turning pages, the narrative eventually becomes overreliant on the deliberate withholding of information. As Whitney and Aina keep secrets from one another, so Watson keeps secrets from us. The cultural references – Giacometti, Copenhagen, the Vikings – indicate a world that is recognisably ours, and a background of accelerating climate change suggests the narrative is taking place in the near future. There are vague mentions of diminishing resources and weather events, of a population in crisis. Yet these avenues remain unexplored. How well readers respond to this novel will depend on how far they are prepared to tolerate an accumulating fuzziness around the facts. The novel’s finer details are made puzzling by the similar lack of a rationale. Whitney and Aina and their former friends appear to remember a time before the invasive restrictions that have come to determine their lives and futures, yet they remain curiously, almost determinedly passive. No one discusses the past, not even in secret. Whitney’s obeisance to the regime is particularly perplexing, most especially in being entirely unexamined. Once again, it is as if the author has come to rely on obfuscation to gain an effect; things are the way they are, not for any real reason but “just because”. There will be readers who respond so strongly to Watson’s transparent prose, to the curiously lulling strangeness of his world, that they can set aside the trivial matter of cause and effect. For this reader, at least, the vastness and profusion of plot holes and the relentlessly accelerating illogic that governs the final quarter of the novel explode any such necessary suspension of disbelief. There is no doubting Watson’s talent at the sentence level, but his lack of rigour around core ideas left me frustrated and unconvinced. • Metronome is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99).

LeBron James owns plenty of blame in his personal annus horribilis,2022-04-07T08:00:07Z,Andrew Lawrence,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7yx4,"Two years ago the world may have been upside down, but all was right in Laker Nation. After a decade of futility the Purple and Gold were on top of the NBA, champions once again. As the confetti fell inside a largely empty arena inside the NBA bubble, the best player on the planet had made good on his promise to put the franchise “back in the position where it belongs.” Given the Lakers’ habit of hanging around the NBA finals once they finally break back in, it did indeed seem as if LeBron James &amp; Co were only just getting warmed up. But it turns out that the heat radiating from the afterglow of that victory may well have been the earliest sign of the meltdown to come. On Tuesday, five days before the NBA regular season’s closing curtain, the LeBron-era Lakers hit their nadir. They went to Phoenix with James sidelined through injury and fell to the Suns, 121-110, their seventh defeat in a row. To add insult to injury, the Suns loss ruled the Lakers out of the playoff’s play-in round, a lifeline James once bemoaned quite emphatically. The self-styled GOAT was even roasted at the Oscars, with co-host Regina Hall arguably landing the night’s third-most provocative joke. Even though LA have weathered their share of bad breaks this season – not least a slew of aches, pains and Covid absences that has forced coach Frank Vogel to deploy 24 different players and 39 starting lineups – much of the blame for the Lakers’ wayward prospects should fall at the feet of James, a postseason spectator for just the fourth time in his illustrious career. After all, he isn’t just the straw that stirs the Lakers. He mixes the drink too as shadow general manager, exerting his sweeping influence from inside the locker room and through his player agency, Klutch Sports. Unlike his idol Michael Jordan, whose desire to pick his own teammates was vigorously checked by the gimlet-eyed Bulls general manager Jerry Krause, James has yet to find a front office he couldn’t steamroller. His fingerprints are all over the Lakers’ 2019 trade for Anthony Davis, a wildly talented big man who is oft-injured and generally averse to putting an entire team on his back. They’re all over the August trade for Russell Westbrook, a hall of fame-bound point guard who’s not only missing a steady jump shot but also a modicum of patience. In those trades, Brandon Ingram (24 years old), Kyle Kuzma (26), Lonzo Ball (24) and other fresh legs and potential draft picks were shipped away to maximise the 37-year-old James’s late-career window. James’s fourth year in LA began with him as the centrepiece of a rotation also made up of Westbrook (33), Carmelo Anthony (37), a second tour of Rajon Rondo (36) and a third tour of Dwight Howard (36). Suffice to say: This would’ve been an awesome Cleveland Cavaliers team in 2008. It’s bad enough that James has missed 23 games this season. He resorted to playing heroball, or thoroughly against type. He chased double-doubles and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s all-time scoring mark while the Lakers slipped out of the playoff picture and into irrelevance. During the All-Star break in Cleveland James told the Athletic’s Jason Lloyd that he was entertaining the idea of a second homecoming. In that same interview, James reiterated a desire to play with his eldest son, Bronny – who isn’t near the NBA shoo-in his father was at his age. Unfair, maybe, but remember: James started this. Perhaps most embarrassing: After the LA’s Super Bowl triumph in February, James tossed around an idea for a triple-team ‘parade of champions’ with Rams, Dodgers and Lakers. Again, his title was in 2020. James even brought the typically stoic Abdul-Jabbar to a boil with his shrugging endorsement of a Spider-Man meme that tapped into a broader sense of exasperation in distinguishing from Covid, cold and flu symptoms. (Abdul-Jabbar’s point is that as an outspoken advocate for vaccinations, James can’t afford to be so thoughtless.) In general, James has looked for all the world like pretty much exactly what ESPN’s Brian Windhorst says he is: the peripatetic superstar who burns too bright for any team to hold on to beyond four years. “Call it organisational fatigue,” the dean of Bron-ologists said on the ESPN morning show Get Up. “It happened the first time in Cleveland. They ran out of draft picks, they had a bunch of guys in their mid-30s. … He goes to Miami, four years, great run, they run out of draft picks. In his last game, three guys retired. … He goes to Cleveland, four years, great run. They run out of draft picks, they’ve got old guys. Here we are in LA, fourth year, the oldest team we’ve seen in NBA history, they’re out of draft picks. They’re exhausted.” If the pattern holds, there’s no way James – an unrestricted free agent in 2023 – signs up for two or more years of misery in Los Angeles. Sure, he’ll always be fondly remembered for the championship he won for the city during Covid – the hardest title in history, if you ask him. And one meltdown year isn’t enough to ruin a 20-year standard. He can still call himself king if he likes. He just needs to do the honourable thing and own this Lakers landfill fire as his personal annus horribilis."
"‘Political’ government ads should be probed by integrity agencies, Victorian opposition says",2022-04-07T07:43:53Z,Benita Kolovos,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7my6,"Victoria’s opposition is urging the state’s integrity agencies to investigate government advertising campaigns found to be in breach of state laws due to their political nature. The Victorian auditor general’s office (Vago) report tabled in parliament on Wednesday found the “Our Fair Share” campaign and several Big Build advertisements breached laws passed in 2017 to stop public sector agencies publishing political advertising. This came after the Independent Broad‑based Anti‑corruption Commission (Ibac) and the Victorian ombudsman said in 2019 that they could not justify launching an investigation into the advertisements. Opposition spokesperson Brad Battin on Thursday wrote to Ibac and the ombudsman, urging them to take another look at the advertisements in light of Vago’s findings. “I would respectfully ask that you reconsider this decision and investigate the advertising campaigns referred to in the report as part of your larger investigation into the politicisation of the public service,” his letter, obtained by Guardian Australia, states. The ombudsman is currently investigating whether the public service has been politicised after a referral from state parliament’s upper house earlier this year. The $1.7m Our Fair Share campaign, which ran during the 2019 federal election, advocated for more commonwealth funding for Victorian public schools, healthcare and transport projects. The Vago report said the campaign was political because it could “easily be seen” to promote the Victorian government while attacking the federal government. Two advertisements from the $11.5m campaign for the Big Build, were also found to be unlawful as they promoted the works before providing information in the public interest about disruptions. In 2019, the Ibac and the Victorian ombudsman wrote to the state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, about the Our Fair Share campaign after receiving complaints. In the letter, which was appended to the Vago report, they said an investigation could not be justified. They said it was “highly unlikely” that statements by the heads of the departments involved, in which they said they were “motivated solely by the public interest”, could be contradicted. However, the agencies said the timing and content of the campaign “would have had the effect of influencing public sentiment against the government of the commonwealth. “This would have been the likely perception of a reasonable member of the Victorian public, whatever their political allegiance,” they said in the letter. They proposed amendments to the laws to “reinforce the importance of an apolitical public sector and to advance the wider public interest”. The government, however, did not make any changes. On Thursday, Battin said an investigation should examine “if the premier, ministers, or their respective offices used any undue influence that led to the production of illegal political advertising”. He also stated the creation and approval of these ads potentially breached impartiality requirements under Codes of Conduct for Victorian public sector employees and ministers and parliamentary secretaries. Battin said Victorians deserve the truth as to how millions of dollars were allowed to be spent on unlawful and improper advertisements. “Daniel Andrews has been caught out breaking his own laws and treating people’s money as his own,” he said in a statement. “Victorians deserve the truth as to how and why this occurred.” Andrews, however, continued to defend the advertisements. “These matters have already been looked at by those authorities and they’ve made it very clear what the view is,” Andrews said. “It’s breathtaking that you think lowly of a government that stands up for its state, that’s what we do. That’s what we always do.”"
UK house prices hit record high but cost of living crisis likely to cool market,2022-04-07T07:43:40Z,Kalyeena Makortoff,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nbg,"UK house prices hit a record of £282,753 in March but are likely to ease over the next year as homebuyers face higher interest rates and the cost of living squeeze, Halifax has said. The average cost of a home rose by 1.4% on February, according to Halifax’s monthly property index, and is 11% higher than a year ago, about the largest annual increase since the 2007 financial crisis. The new record is about £28,113 higher than a year ago, not far off the average UK earnings over the same period of £28,860. March was also the ninth consecutive month that prices have grown, with monthly gains at their highest level since September, when they rose by 1.7%. Average prices have risen by £43,577 since the first coronavirus lockdown in 2020. The sustained increase has been driven by a shortage of houses for sale and an increase in demand for larger homes linked to the pandemic “race for space”. Hybrid-working trends and more time spent at home prompted many people living in cities to consider relocating to more rural areas. Russell Galley, Halifax’s managing director, said: “Although there is some recent evidence of more homes coming on to the market, the fundamental issue remains that too many buyers are chasing too few properties.” However, Halifax said the cost of living crisis – with households squeezed by rising energy and food bills – was likely to dampen the increase in house prices over the coming year. The UK’s annual inflation rate reached 6.2% in February, the highest in three decades, and the Bank of England said that figure could rise to 10% later this year, putting further pressure on living standards. It is likely to result in higher interest rates, as part of policymakers’ efforts to keep prices in check. The Bank of England had already increased interest rates to pre-pandemic levels of 0.75% last month. “In the long term, we know the performance of the housing market remains inextricably linked to the health of the wider economy,” Galley said. “There is no doubt that households face a significant squeeze on real earnings, and the difficulty for policymakers in needing to support the economy, yet contain inflation, is now even more acute because of the impact of the war in Ukraine. “Buyers are therefore dealing with the prospect of higher interest rates and a higher cost of living. With affordability metrics already extremely stretched, these factors should lead to a slowdown in house price inflation over the next year.”"
Telstra to scan all text messages for malicious content in anti-scam program,2022-04-07T07:31:36Z,Josh Taylor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mk9,"Telstra has launched new technology that automatically scans all text messages for malicious content on its mobile network in a move aimed at halting the explosion in scam SMS messages. The company’s outgoing CEO, Andy Penn, said in a blog post on Thursday the company had witnessed massive growth in reports of scam text messages – particularly the Flubot scam targeting Android devices, which installs malware on the phone to steal credit card and other personal information. He said in 2021 Telstra had 11,000 reports of malicious texts to Android devices, compared to just 50 in 2020. “That’s why we’ve turned on a brand-new feature to find and block SMS scam messages with suspicious links as they travel across our network and stop many of them before they reach your mobile device,” he said. “We know it’s working because our people have been on an internal pilot program for the last three months. Around two and a half thousand employees have taken part and we’ve been successful in detecting and blocking hundreds of scam SMS messages every day.” The technology has been rolled out and switched on for every mobile device on Telstra’s network – including those signed up to other providers using Telstra’s mobile network like Belong. The text messages will be automatically scanned on Telstra’s network before being delivered to customers, and if it looks suspicious – with malicious links or similar patterns and characteristics to other messages – Telstra will block the message from being delivered. Penn said that in some cases, specialists would have to review the contents of text messages that might have been wrongly flagged, but the specialist will not be able to see the details of the intended recipient of the text message. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning There will also be protections to ensure businesses, government departments and emergency alert text messages don’t get flagged and blocked. Penn said while the new filter will block a significant number of scam texts, it is not foolproof, and scammers constantly evolve their tactics. Those who wish to opt out of the system can SMS 0438 214 682 with the words FILTER OFF, or FILTER ON to opt back in. A spokesperson for Optus said the company has advanced filtering and machine learning on its SMS systems, and during 2021 had blocked nearly 30m text messages related to the Flubot scam alone. A Vodafone spokesperson said it began blocking spam and scam texts in 2014, and upgraded its services in 2020 with “a sophisticated SMS firewall that identifies and blocks scammers from reaching our customers.” “Protecting Vodafone customers from the scourge of scams will always be a priority,” the spokesperson said. “Based on a combination of artificial intelligence and user-enabled rulesets, our system has blocked more than 522m scam text messages in the past year alone. In the same period, we have also identified and blocked more than 26m scam calls from reaching our customers.” The telco industry is currently finalising an update to the industry code on scam calls to incorporate requirements for dealing with scam SMS. The chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, told a Senate estimates hearing on Wednesday ScamWatch had noticed a 50% decrease in reported phone-based scams as a result of telecommunications companies taking action. “We believe that’s in part because of disruption by the telecommunications companies alerted by and with information that ScamWatch is providing them,” she said. Cass-Gottlieb said it had caused scammers to switch to investment-related scams, with financial losses up to $72m and cryptocurrency becoming the most common payment method. The ACCC said there was a 90% increase in financial losses from the scams in the first three months of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, with 49,548 reports of losses, and a total of $103m reported as lost to scams in that period."
Kickboxing club in Moldova becomes a refuge for Ukrainian children,2022-04-07T07:30:07Z,Betsy Joles and Polly Braden in Moldova,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ehv,"On the night before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Alimov Rustam was in Odesa, across the border from his home country of Moldova, to celebrate a friend’s birthday. When his wife awoke to the sound of distant explosions, Rustam tried to reassure her that everything was fine. He soon realised it wasn’t. The next day, the couple left for Moldova to find a line of cars already queueing at the border when they approached. Rustam was used to traveling to Ukraine for his work as a kickboxing trainer. When he learned the scale of the Russian attack, he knew he had to mobilise quickly. Using Viber, a messaging app, he started inviting Ukrainian friends from the kickboxing community to come to Moldova, where he would arrange for their stay. Julia Moisieva and her friend Narine, whose husband is also a kickboxing coach, answered that call. They packed their children into the car and headed for the border, which is usually a short trip from Odesa. Twenty-eight hours later, they arrived in Moldova. For Tymor, Moisieva’s seven-year-old son, Garuda kickboxing gym in Chișinău, Moldova’s capital, was a soft place to land. There, he has a routine that is like his own back in Ukraine, and playmates in the neighbourhood that is now his temporary home. In a second Garuda gym in Trușeni, a village outside the capital, another pair of Ukrainian children have found refuge in kickboxing. Anna Miroshnichenko and Natalie Munteanu were college classmates in Ukraine before Munteanu moved to Moldova with her husband. When war broke out in Ukraine, she invited her old classmate to come to stay with her in Trușeni. Miroshnichenko, along with her best friend from Odesa, Elena Tkach, soon arrived with their daughters, and a house of four people became 10. Munteanu’s daughter, Ioana, had started kickboxing a few months before, and when the trainer at the gym said Ukrainian children could train for free, she invited her new houseguests to join her. The girls took to the sport quickly. “I used to do cheerleading in Ukraine, and I never imagined that I would go to kickboxing,” says 10-year-old Anastasia Miroshnichenko. When Ioana first started kickboxing, she said the other parents in her village did not approve. “They said it’s not a place for girls,” Munteanu says. Now, kickboxing has become a cherished hobby for all three girls, and a distraction for Ksenia and Anastasia, who came from Ukraine. Their trainer translates instructions in the class from Romanian into Russian so they can understand. Munteanu says it was difficult at first to merge three families but now they live as one unit, sharing news and crying together when things get especially tough. “It seems that we are already a team,” she says. The mothers from Ukraine, who came to Moldova without their husbands, say the sport provides an outlet for their daughters during a chaotic time. “Thanks to kickboxing, they don’t think about the fact that they are in a foreign country,” Tkach says. “They are concentrated on new emotions, new feelings, so we are thankful for that.” Rustam says trainers at the kickboxing gym are used to working with children from difficult circumstances since they often work with youth from at-risk communities. He explained the situation of the newcomers to their other students, who quickly accepted them into the group. Rustam says the new students were recognisable just by their uniforms – yellow and blue, like the Ukrainian flag. His colleagues across the border have started holding classes again in some cities but say it is no longer the same because so many children who trained with them have left the country. Moisieva says her children cried frequently at first, pleading to go home. But they have calmed down over time as they settle into a rhythm in Chișinău. “Every day it became easier to accept this situation,” she says. Tymor goes to the kickboxing gym three times a week, where he practises skills such as the splits, back bridges and pushups, as well as sparring. The girls in Trușeni say they are also learning how to defend themselves, which they see as an important skill for women. Ten-year-old Ksenia says the kindness of her Moldovan coaches has made her want to keep fighting. “We would like to continue to do this kind of sport, thanks to the trainers.”"
Invasion of the lawn prawn: heavy rain drives tiny back yard crustaceans into Queensland homes,2022-04-07T07:19:11Z,Jordyn Beazley,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mba,"People on Australia’s east coast are finding strange uninvited guests lodged in their carpets and hopping around their homes after record rainfall. The small dull brown creatures are a type of prawn that live on land. They’re known as lawn prawns or forest hoppers, and they’re joining the growing list of critters searching for dry shelter in people’s homes in New South Wales and Queensland where frequent heavy rain has already caused several floods this year. “It’s not very often people see them and that’s why it’s quite surprising for people to find them in their homes,” said Shane Ahyong, a research scientist on marine invertebrates at the Australian Museum. “Usually they’re hidden, unless you’re looking for them you won’t find them.” Queensland resident Anne Carlin was baffled when she found hundreds in her home, posting a photo to Twitter of the “miniature prawn” and asking “Does anyone know what this is”. Another Queensland resident, Helen Bender, told the ABC she first noticed the tiny creatures dead in her home in December. She spent weeks trying to figure out what they were and whether they were a problem. The lawn prawns are harmless and are normally found by the thousands in moist soil beneath leaf litter on Australia’s east coast. But unlike their marine cousins, they can’t breathe underwater. So as the heavy rains swamp their habitat, they’re climbing into people’s homes. Once they are in people’s homes, they eventually die from lack of moisture, turning from brown to pink. While their marine counterparts are a popular dish, the lawn prawns do not compare on taste. “You can eat them if you want,” Ahyong said with a laugh. “But they won’t do much for you, they’re very small. “The key message is don’t see them as a threat, see them as a benefit. Please don’t use pesticides because that will kill them, having a lot of them in your leaf litter is the sign of a healthy system.” There are 30 native species of lawn prawns and these are some of what will be found in back yards. But there are also a number of introduced species that are thought to have been transported here in soil from Sri Lanka or India. “Besides the fact they’re just really cool, it’s good they’re being brought to people’s attention because we don’t often think of crustaceans in our back yard,” Ahyong said. “You think of insects, and you think of bees and birds and lizards. But crustaceans are actually playing a really important role in the ecosystem.” They act as a “recycler”, improving soil by eating decaying leaves and breaking down organic matter. “If you go into the back yard and dig around under mature leaf litter you’ll often see them. To escape predators they hop and bounce around. If you see things jumping around or shuffling quickly in the soil, it’s probably them.” Though it is yet unknown how the lawn prawn populations that live in state forests have been affected by floods, Ahyong said he doesn’t consider the populations of back yard lawn prawns found in homes at risk. But increased warming and flooding resulting from the climate crisis will inevitably have an impact on lawn prawns, he said. “Combine climate change with urbanisation and habitat loss, we are really reducing the number of potential sites that these animals can live in.” “Because they’re hiding in the soil we can destroy swathes of their environment without even knowing it, and that’s bad news for the animals that rely on them for what they do in the soil and rely on them for food.” Heavy rains have also affected the better known marine prawns. The floods have flushed farmed sea prawns out to sea, with one fisher catching an escaped prawn used as breeding stock in the commercial farms that weighed more than 20 times the average king prawn. While fishers are warning prawns will be scarce this season, John Morrongiello, a senior lecturer in marine biology at the University of Melbourne, said the nutrients being flushed into the sea from rivers are spawning fertile breeding grounds that will eventually be a boon for fisheries."
Art of diplomacy: 300 years of Japanese art in Britain’s royal collection,2022-04-07T07:00:07Z,Nicholas Wroe,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y55pk,"In 1881, two young British princes serving as midshipmen in the Royal Navy visited Japan, where they had a meeting with the emperor. This encounter wasn’t the most significant between the royal families of Britain and Japan, or the most extravagant – the princes bought a metal teapot and cups as a gift for their father in a nascent tourist market – but it was emblematic of the long and complex interaction between the two countries. While in Japan, the princes, aged just 16 and 17, got tattoos on their arms: a couple of storks for Prince Albert and a dragon and a tiger for the future George V, Prince George. “Tattoos were part of naval culture and were a British aristocratic fashion in the late 19th century,” explains Rachel Peat, the curator of a new exhibition, Japan: Courts and Culture, which opened at the Queen’s Gallery this week. “But in Japan, tattooing had very different connotations. It has been both a revered art form and at various times illegal in Japanese history, so there is a mystique and almost danger to getting one, which might well have been part of the allure for the tourists.” The sense of something distant, desirable and difficult to access has been a key part of the western fascination for Japanese art, culture and objects. It is evidenced in this first exhibition dedicated to works of art from Japan in the royal collection, for which the Queen’s galleries have been specially redesigned. While it is not a comprehensive survey of Japanese art – no calligraphy or kimonos and only one netsuke miniature sculpture – it reveals an engrossing story of diplomacy, taste and power through artistry and craftsmanship. The first royal contact came in 1613, with an exchange of gifts that included a set of samurai armour, shortly before Japan closed itself to western influence for more than 200 years. Not that this put an end to the attraction for all things Japanese. If anything, the closure of Japan made its products all the more fashionable and sought after, and, via Chinese and Dutch merchants, the royal family continued to build its collection of porcelain and lacquer products, whose secrets of manufacture were still unknown in the west. The reopening of Japan in the 19th century prompted a renewal of royal visits and a new appreciation and understanding of Japanese art in the west, and the start of the 20th century saw warm relations between the countries. The rupture of the second world war was healed in the 1950s with a coronation gift from Emperor Hirohito to the new British queen and was widely regarded as an attempt to use art to symbolise a new era of cooperation. “These objects are normally dispersed across 15 different historic and royal residences,” says Peat. “So bringing them together and seeing them as a whole is quite something. Many of the objects are gifts directly commissioned by the imperial family, and in some cases even designed by them. The result is work of the most exquisite quality, but also work that reveals a fascinating history – complete with peaks and troughs – of an ever-changing relationship not only between courts, but between cultures.” From east to west: four artworks from the show Folding screen painting, 1860 This painting depicting Mount Fuji in the spring – one of a pair sent to Queen Victoria in 1860 – was thought to be lost, but was rediscovered during preparations for the exhibition. It is made of silk with hinges of paper and gold leaf, and is extremely fragile. The screens are considered to be paintings not furniture, and would be displayed flat to best show the work of the artists. It was among the first diplomatic gifts to be made after Japan reopened to the world following more than 200 years of isolation. Pair of pastille burners in the form of hares, 1680–1720 (main picture) These decorative porcelain figures represent the year of the rabbit and draw on wider eastern mythology about rabbits or hares being associated with the moon and notions of immortality. They also function as incense burners, with the smoke emerging through holes in the rockwork stumps on which the hares sit. Armour from the Myōchin school, 1537–1850 This samurai armour is constructed from leather, doeskin, horsehair, bear fur, gilt copper, gold filigree and thousands of tiny iron pieces laced together with vibrant blue and red silk to make a flexible covering that is wrapped round the body. It is likely that elements from several suits of armour were used to make this suit, which was presented to Queen Victoria’s son Alfred in 1869. He was the first overseas royal of any nationality to visit modern Japan. Cosmetic box and cover, c.1890–1905 This wooden box decorated with black, gold and silver lacquer was the first diplomatic gift after the second world war, given to the Queen by Hirohito, the Emperor Shōwa, to mark her coronation in 1953. It was made by Shirayama Shōsai who was one of the leading artists during a golden age of lacquer work in the early 20th century. Here he has depicted a heron, whose feathers are picked out in silver lacquer, accented with gold streaks. • Japan: Courts and Culture is at the Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, London, until 12 March."
Is the London Stadium beginning to feel like home for West Ham fans?,2022-04-07T07:00:07Z,Pete May,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7cxx,"West Ham are “massive” to quote the chant of the moment – and so, surprisingly, was the London Stadium in the memorable Europa League win against Sevilla. Six years after moving from Upton Park, the club’s troubled new ground had changed from corporate dome to a cauldron of noise. Is Stratford finally starting to feel like home for Hammers fans? For all Karren Brady’s promises of a successful migration, it did not start well in 2016, with fans who preferred to stand put next to fans who wanted to sit and fights breaking out in an early game against Watford. The stewarding was poor and in a League Cup tie against Chelsea rival fans used the circular concourse to cause aggravation. It seemed difficult to get a chant going all around the vast stadium. The diehards had many complaints: the distance from the pitch, plastic fans, the long walk from Stratford and the sale of popcorn. It was forgotten that sometimes Upton Park could be quiet, too. The club improved the stewarding and moved fans to more appropriate areas, but many problems remained. The nadir for the London Stadium was the pitch invasion during a 3-0 home defeat to Burnley in March 2018. David Moyes was in his first spell as manager with the club, as ever fighting relegation rather than moving to the promised next level. One middle-aged fan planted a corner flag in the centre circle. With the stewards as proactive as the West Ham defence, Mark Noble found himself acting as a makeshift bouncer, manhandling one miscreant and inspiring the Guardian cartoonist David Squires to draw Noble singing “I’m forever throwing Herberts, stewards vanish in thin air”. Several hundred fans gathered around the directors’ box chanting: “You’ve destroyed our club” at owners David Sullivan and David Gold. There didn’t seem any coming back from that. Another problem was how to cover the athletics track. When Sofiane Feghouli scored against NK Domzale in the first Europa League match there and kissed the massive green carpet around the pitch, it highlighted how the playing area looked like one giant chunk of AstroTurf. The then manager Slaven Bilic complained in 2017 that it made it psychologically difficult for his players to track back: “You look up and it is not easy, because everything is green ahead of you, to appreciate exactly where is the end of the pitch.” For a long period there was a standoff between West Ham and the stadium’s owners, the London Legacy Development Corporation, which would not allow a claret carpet to be installed over the running track area. Eventually, relations improved and the carpet finally arrived in April 2019. It was not, as some feared, a shagpile offcut from Sullivan’s home, but a claret surround with the club’s name emblazoned at the sides. Michail Antonio was so impressed he celebrated a goal against Leicester by lying down and fondly stroking the carpet. Renaming the East Stand the Billy Bonds Stand was another positive move. Bonds came on to the pitch before the game against Newcastle and was moved to tears by the reception he received. But even the Irons’ magic carpet couldn’t prevent the Manuel Pellegrini years turning sour. Moyes returned and West Ham were out of the relegation zone on goal difference when lockdown happened. They played their final games behind closed doors and stayed up. In the Covid season of 2020-21 Moyes started to make dramatic progress. West Ham finished an improbable sixth and the fans had a team they could be proud of, if only on TV. When 10,000 fans were allowed for the final game of the season against Southampton they discovered the stands at either end had been squared off, making it much more like a football ground. When this season began with a 4-1 home demolition of Leicester the fans realised they were grateful to be back watching West Ham, whatever stadium they were in. It felt like a homecoming. Fans were more used to their pubs and matchday routes. The incremental improvements had worked: the carpet, the squared ends, playing music outside the stadium, the razzle-dazzle before matches of flame throwers, DJs, bubble machines and light shows. The ground was slowly developing an identity. Home wins against Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea created the best atmosphere since the last season at the Boleyn. And selling popcorn really didn’t matter much. Memories are being made, such as a tearful Andriy Yarmolenko scoring against Villa and raising his hands to the sky. The Sevilla match put it up a notch again. When the two goals went in under the lights the whole place was bouncing. The London Stadium will never be as intimate as Upton Park and the stands at the sides really could do with being closer to the pitch. But opposition teams do not fancy playing there now and 60,000 fans turn up every game. A new generation don’t even remember the Boleyn. It has been a long journey, but it does feel like the Hammers finally have a ground that is not only literally massive, but also has the power to intimidate once more.

Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta,2022-04-07T07:00:07Z,Andy Bull at Augusta,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7yxk,"You don’t need to prove you have been vaccinated to get into the Masters this year, don’t need to show a negative test or wear a face covering. “Feels like a normal Masters again,” said Rory McIlroy. And he’s right, around about here it’s almost like the past two years never happened. Almost. There is one big little difference. They’re all out of Georgia peach ice cream sandwiches at the concession stands. Serious business this. The sandwiches were the outstanding achievement of the last Augusta National chairman, Billy Payne, and all the justification needed to explain his induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame. Payne’s successor, Fred Ridley, was asked about them on Wednesday morning, and replied, with appropriate gravitas: “We have encountered supply chain issues, just like everyone, in everything we’ve done.” Ridley talked through a couple of other changes, trivial things in comparison, such as the major renovations to the course. According to McIlroy, the 11th “is basically a new hole”, and the 15th is different, too. The club have lengthened both. At 11 they have extended the pond, removed one group of the trees and planted another further down the right side of the fairway and at 15 they have reshaped the green. They often tinker with the course, but these changes are a little more drastic than usual, the idea, as always, is to make sure it is still a course that offers the right balance between risk and reward. What the club have not done is the one change everyone was expecting them to make at the 13th. The club’s co-founder Bobby Jones loved that hole, which he said offers players “a tempting and dangerous” decision about whether to bend the tee-shot around the corner so they can reach the green in two. At least, that’s what it’s supposed to do. These days the 13th feels toothless. The players hit it so long off the tee they are left with a short iron into the green. The club bought a patch of land behind the tee-box off the neighbouring Augusta Country Club, which everyone assumed meant they were going to be able to lengthen the hole. They haven’t done it yet. Ridley knows there is a problem. The club have been talking for years about fixing it and he reiterated it on Wednesday. “The 13th hole does not have the same challenges that it had historically.” The reason they are reluctant to do anything about it, he said, is that it’s such a classic hole. “Probably along with 12, and maybe 15, those three holes are where the most history has been made at Augusta National.” It is where Arnold Palmer made an eagle with a second ball after a long dispute with a rules official when he won in 1958; where Curtis Strange blew a two-shot Sunday lead by hitting it into the creek in 1985; and where Jack Nicklaus picked up a crucial birdie in ’86. “I can just remember as a young guy watching the Masters, some of the triumphs and tragedies there,” Ridley said. “So that probably has been a counter to doing anything.” The worry is they will end up like the one of those amateur artists who decides it is a good idea to try to touch up a fading masterpiece. Ridley is clearly daunted by the prospect of tampering with it. And maybe he is right to be. The club have always caught between the old and the new, the desire to do right by the traditions, and to keep improving, too. There are times when they do get it wrong. Ridley’s recent decision to allow the media group Dude Perfect to shoot a YouTube film with Bryson DeChambeau at Amen Corner felt like a misstep. Ridley was asked how he imagined Jones would feel if he came back to see Augusta. “I hope he would be proud,” he said. “I hope that he would feel that we continue to carry the tradition and values we thought were so important in the game.” Just so long as he wasn’t here the day DeChambeau was tossing Frisbees around Amen Corner for the sake of a viral video. But Ridley said, Dude Perfect “has 57 million followers on YouTube and that got my attention”. The clip ended up “the No 1 YouTube video at the time”. That is quite a change for a club who refused to televise the front nine for so many years."
"‘Learning to live with it’? From Covid to climate breakdown, it’s the new way of failing",2022-04-07T07:00:06Z,George Monbiot,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7jh3,"We have a new term for doing nothing: “learning to live with”. Learning to live with Covid means abandoning testing, isolation and wearing masks in public places. Living with it, dying from it, what’s the difference? The same applies to climate breakdown. It’s not just that countries like the UK have failed to play their part in preventing this catastrophe. They have also failed to prepare for it. While our primary effort should still be to decarbonise our economies, to prevent even worse impacts, we also need to brace ourselves for the heating that’s now unavoidable. But, as the government’s climate change committee points out, adaptation in the UK is “under-resourced, underfunded and often ignored”. The head of the committee has spoken of a “wilful reluctance” to include adaptation in policymaking. In the five years since the committee last reported on this issue, for example, 570,000 new homes have been built without heat adaptation: in other words, as temperatures rise they’re likely to overheat in the summer. Doubtless, many of them have also been built on flood plains. As always, it’s much cheaper and easier to prepare for such disasters than to seek to live with them. But government policy is to wish away these problems. This government is incompetent by design. Doing nothing is what Tory donors pay for. Doing nothing is what the billionaire press demands. Doubtless we’ll soon be told we need to take “personal responsibility” for ensuring our homes are not flooded and our power lines are not destroyed by storms. But this failure to act is not confined to the government: it’s a general failure. On Sunday, the Cambrian railway line that runs from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth reopened after six weeks of emergency engineering. In February, the Severn, swollen by a series of storms, had knocked out the ballast, leaving the track suspended in mid-air in 33 places. As I know to my cost, because I used to rely on it, this is the latest in an apparently endless series of disasters to afflict the line. One bridge alone – the Black Bridge near Machynlleth – was closed about 30 times as a result of river flooding in the 2010s and 10 times in 2020 alone. Last summer, at a cost of £3.6m, Network Rail raised it by a metre. Again, the line was shut for six weeks. But none of this solves the underlying problem: the fast and violent response of local rivers to heavy rainfall. As climate chaos brings more intense rain, this is likely to become even worse. There is a rapidly developing science called natural flood management. It shows how, with the right interventions upstream, rivers can be slowed and their flood peaks reduced. This involves, for example, increasing their “hydraulic roughness”, allowing them to braid and meander and form islands and other obstacles that slow the flow; improving infiltration, so that water soaks into the ground rather than flashing off the surface; and reconnecting rivers to their floodplains, so that wetlands and fields are flooded (with compensation for farmers), rather than homes and infrastructure. Fascinatingly, a new tranche of evidence suggests that among the most effective interventions is reintroducing beavers. Their dams, especially when there is a long series in the course of the river, appear to be highly effective at holding back flood waters and reducing flood peaks. The beaver could be the rail traveller’s best friend. Long sections of the rivers affecting the Cambrian line were straightened and shortened during an entirely misguided phase of river management in the mid-20th century. At that time, engineers, “without any apparent scientific evidence base”, according to a paper in the journal Progress in Physical Geography, believed that rivers needed to be cleared, dredged and “trained”. The result is that water rushes down them much faster than it would otherwise have done. Using only hard engineering to control floods – building higher walls and embankments – tends to divert water to the next crisis point. It requires constant reinforcement and upgrading. But when I asked the company what works it had undertaken to slow the flow and reduce the flood peaks of the rivers that affect the line, it told me: “Network Rail is not carrying out any work of the nature you listed. Our focus is on building additional resilience into local rail infrastructure.” It is now shelling out another £2m on “rock armour” to protect the parts of the line washed out in February. As so often in the UK, the idea of making the problem smaller, rather than simply pouring more money, rocks and concrete into making the defences higher, doesn’t seem to occur. Working only at the bottom of the catchments, our engineers wait for a wall of water to arrive and pray that this time their defences are high enough. There is no learning involved in “learning to live with”. It tends to mean an inability to adapt to new realities, and in some cases looks like a total retreat into abstraction. In 2020, the US conservative commentator Ben Shapiro claimed that 10 feet of sea level rise wouldn’t be a problem, because people could just “sell their homes and move”. Sell them to mermaids, presumably. A few days ago, a senior executive at the Institute of Economic Affairs suggested that instead of preventing climate breakdown, we could simply “build sea walls”. It is not just denial we’re up against. It’s a belief in magic. George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist. He will discuss Regenesis at a Guardian Live event on Monday 30 May.

Senators allege they were ‘treated with contempt’ when police called to remove them from WA prison,2022-04-07T06:55:30Z,Lorena Allam,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7tmh,"Two senators allege they were treated with “contempt and disrespect” at Western Australia’s Hakea prison when a visit with the superintendent was suddenly cancelled and police were called to remove them from his office. Greens senators Dorinda Cox and Lidia Thorpe – both prominent Aboriginal women – say they had “a meeting booked” to speak with the prison superintendent on Wednesday and were inside the facility before being told it would not take place. “We were standing in the doorway of the superintendent’s office when informed by the superintendent he would no longer meet with us, having been escorted into his office by prison staff with full approval,” Cox, a Yamatji Noongar woman, said on Thursday. But the WA justice department has disputed the senators’ version of events. “There are established protocols for any members of parliament wishing to attend departmental facilities,” a spokesperson said on Wednesday night. “After receiving the request today [on Wednesday] the prison telephoned senator Thorpe’s office advising staff that a meeting couldn’t take place outside of these protocols. “The senators arrived at the prison without the requisite approval. As such, a meeting couldn’t take place and the senators were advised of this. They were asked to leave and they initially refused this request. At no time were the senators detained at the prison.” After leaving, Thorpe said in a Facebook video the pair had earlier on Wednesday “set up a meeting with the superintendent … he agreed to meet with us, we went through the proper process of contacting the secretary … but when we got to the office we were told he didn’t want to meet with us any more”. Cox said the pair had already been ushered into the superintendent’s office before being told the meeting was cancelled. She said they remained in the office “for some hours” and were informed “repeatedly” that someone from senior leadership would meet with them. The senators allege one prison officer in the room filmed Cox with his mobile phone despite her requesting him to stop. They said they were then informed the police had been called to escort them from the prison. Cox – a former WA police officer – said this was an “absolute insult”. “This was a display of contempt and disrespect on part of prison authorities,” the pair said in a joint statement. The senators said they were considering making “a more formal complaint” about their treatment. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Cox and Thorpe said they had “respectfully” sought a meeting at Hakea prison after the death of 22-year-old Noongar man Ricky Lee Cound, who died in mid-March after being found unresponsive in his cell. Cound had been transferred from Acacia prison following a riot. His family has said he spent a significant amount of time in lockdown in the weeks leading up to his death, that he had been self-harming, and had been in need of mental health treatment. At the time, WA’s justice department said the death was not suspicious and police were preparing a report for the coroner. “It’s an embarrassment to the WA government,” Cox said in a Facebook live video filmed at the prison gates on Wednesday. “We have come here in good faith on behalf of the family to ask questions about the death of this young man. It’s unacceptable in 2022 that we – two black female senators – were told to get out of a prison. We’re here trying to … work on the prevention of deaths in custody.”"
Melbourne woman avoids jail for killing baby by laying her on railway tracks,2022-04-07T06:47:14Z,Adeshola Ore,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7m7m,"A Melbourne mother who was suffering severe postpartum depression when she killed her three-month-old daughter by placing her in front of a train has been spared jail. Melissa Arbuckle, 32, pleaded guilty to one count of infanticide over her daughter Lily’s death at a train station in Upwey, in Melbourne’s east, on 11 July last year. Arbuckle had laid beside her daughter on the tracks but survived the accident with fractures and internal bleeding. She was later diagnosed with postpartum depression and psychosis, including auditory hallucinations. Lily’s father, who has requested not to be named, told the court he loved his daughter more than life itself and had struggled to find light in his life since the incident. Justice Jane Dixon told the Victorian supreme court she believed it was “extremely unlikely” Arbuckle would re-offend and released her on an adjourned undertaking for three years. This allows her to live unsupervised in the community, but will require future appearances before court to ensure she is compliant. “The facts of this case plainly reveal extenuating circumstances, and your character and sensible cooperation with treatment and supervision are already in evidence,” Dixon said. “The fact that the severity of your postpartum depression was overlooked is an unfortunate feature that this case has in common with certain other cases of infanticide.” Dixon noted Arbuckle’s “bright prospects” for rehabilitation were not challenged by the prosecution. The court heard Arbuckle’s’s postpartum depression, suicidal ideations and psychosis had subsided after medication and psychiatric community-based treatment. Dixon told the court Arbuckle’s psychologist believed imprisonment would have a “significant and detrimental” impact on her mental health. Dixon said that when considering an appropriate sentence, she had taken into account the victim impact statements of Lily’s father, her great-aunt and the train driver who activated the emergency brakes and shut his eyes before impact. The driver said the incident had changed his life, with police sirens and baby noises now triggering severe distress. The court heard this week that Arbuckle, who was on bail awaiting sentencing, had a “significantly disturbed mind” at the time of the incident. Her defence barrister, Megan Tittensor SC, said the new mother – who had a perfectionist personality – mistakenly believed Lily was suffering from shaken baby syndrome and that it was inevitable she would die. The court heard she had a “fixated delusional belief” she had harmed her child and they were both broken. Arbuckle, a well respected vet, took her daughter for a walk in a pram before she began searching for train speeds and timetables on her mobile. Just after 5pm she was seen holding her daughter and using her arm to wave at the passing train. Minutes later, she placed Lily on the train tracks on the Belgrave line and laid down beside her. Lily died after being airlifted to hospital. Tittensor said Arbuckle did not plan on having another child and suffers immense remorse for the loss of her daughter. Clinical psychologist and the chief executive of Perinatal Anxiety &amp; Depression Australia (PANDA), Julie Borninkhof, said there was no “simplified link” between depression and postnatal psychosis. “It’s a trajectory that is a very unique one and impacted by many things,” Borninkhof said. She said people’s experiences of postnatal psychosis can be impacted by a specific trigger. “Often a worrying thought or experience or exposure to something leads to a hyper-vigilance which is where the individual’s fixation or deluded thoughts or behaviour stems from.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to PANDA, 15% to 22% of mothers experience some form of anxiety or depression during the perinatal period – during pregnancy and up to one year into their child’s life. About 10% of fathers experience the same conditions. Between 0.1% and 0.2% of mothers experience postnatal psychosis, according to a 2017 study in BMC Psychiatry. Symptoms include sudden and dramatic changes in a person’s thinking, behaviour, mood and sleep patterns, and normally emerge in the first four weeks after birth. In Victoria, infanticide carries a maximum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and serves as an alternative to murder. At the time of the conduct, the accused’s balance of mind must be deemed disturbed by the effect of giving birth or a disorder consequent of her giving birth to the child. Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales are the only jurisdictions in Australia that recognise it is a separate offence. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. The PANDA national helpline is 1300 726 306. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Australia stays silent on outcome of meeting with Myanmar coup leader,2022-04-07T06:43:05Z,"Ben Doherty, Daniel Hurst and Ben Butler",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7nvh,"Australia’s ambassador to Myanmar met alleged war criminal and coup leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on Wednesday, in a meeting the junta claims discussed “enhancement of cooperation” between the two countries. Pictures published by the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper show Australia’s ambassador, Andrea Faulkner, and military attache, meeting with the coup leader in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing led the Myanmar military’s pogrom against the ethnic minority Rohingya in 2017, which killed more than 25,000 people and forced more than 700,000 to flee the country, and he engineered a military coup in February 2021, later declaring himself prime minister. Min Aung Hlaing has been recommended by the UN for investigation and prosecution for war crimes and genocide, and personally sanctioned by the US, EU, UK and Canada, but not by Australia. Advocates for Myanmar’s elected government argued the meeting between the coup leader and the representative of a western democracy, would be used as a propaganda tool by the junta to legitimise its unlawful control of Myanmar. Justice for Myanmar’s Yadanar Maung described Australia’s decision to take the meeting as “an act of betrayal” of the Myanmar people. Manny Maung, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the meeting was “deeply unacceptable” and “only serves to lend credibility to a military junta that is accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity”. The meeting has been prominently reported by Myanmar’s state-controlled media, in Burmese, and in English for international audiences. Several pictures of the meeting have been published, including one of the Senior General presenting the ambassador with a painting as a gift. The regime reported that Wednesday’s meeting, in the parlour of Min Aung Hlaing’s office, discussed “the further maintenance of good relations between two countries, enhancement of cooperation in various sectors between governments and peoples of both countries”. It described the CRPH, the elected exiled Myanmar parliament, and the NUG, the exiled National Unity Government , as “terrorists”. Before Senate estimates on Thursday, Katrina Cooper, the deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was questioned by Greens senator Janet Rice over the junta’s reports that the meeting discussed “cooperation in various sectors” and “maintenance of good relations”. Cooper would not comment on the junta’s characterisation of the meeting, but said there were no areas of cooperation with the junta and that the ambassador “asked for a number of things”. “She reiterated Australia’s concern about the situation in Myanmar, she urged the Myanmar military to cease violence, release arbitrary detainees, engage in dialogue and ensure unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The meeting between Australia’s ambassador, who is finishing her posting, and Min Aung Hlaing on Wednesday was one of at least eight meetings or phone calls Australian diplomats and defence officials have had with junta representatives since the coup last February, estimates heard. Rice asked if engaging with the junta risked legitimising its control of the country. Cooper defended Australia’s position, arguing its “limited” engagement with the regime “give us an opportunity to speak directly to the regime”, including to call for an end to violence and grant humanitarian access. “We don’t consider that the engagement we’ve had to date legitimises the current regime.” But Yadanar Maung said the military junta was a terrorist organisation and ‘Australia’s continued engagement with it was “an act of betrayal to its own democracy”. She said the meeting would be used to legitimise the military’s forcible seizure of control of the country. “The latest meeting has given fodder for the junta’s domestic propaganda and is part of a pattern of complicity that stands out from Australia’s democratic allies. Australia has still failed to impose any targeted sanctions on the Myanmar junta and military businesses in response to the coup attempt and the military’s ongoing atrocities, and Australia’s Future Fund continues to invest in companies doing business with the military, including an arms supplier.” Analysis prepared by the Australian Council for International Development (Acfid) shows the US, the UK, Canada and the EU have imposed sanctions against a total of 196 individuals and 172 entities, including subsidiaries, as of February. The chief executive of Acfid, Marc Purcell, said Australia’s failure to impose any additional sanctions against the generals since the coup 14 months ago was “increasingly glaring” compared with actions taken by other like-minded countries. Cooper said the government weighed up “a number of important considerations” when deciding on possible sanctions, including consular matters such as the ongoing “arbitrary detention” of the Australian academic, Prof Sean Turnell. Turnell was an economic adviser to the democratically elected Myanmar government."
This Woman’s Work edited by Kim Gordon and Sinéad Gleeson review – ‘Music undoes me’,2022-04-07T06:30:06Z,Fiona Sturges,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y4nhy,"Music writing has come a long way since the days of the inkies – the papers that would leave marks on their readers’ fingers – when a handful of male gatekeepers dictated the tastes of Britain’s music-loving teens. While female writers were occasionally admitted to this hallowed club, they were the exception rather than the rule. Since then, the music press has been at once democratised and straitened by the advent of free content. Previously marginalised voices are now being heard, even if the rates of pay are largely paltry. This Woman’s Work, an anthology of 16 essays by female writers compiled and edited by Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon and the critic Sinéad Gleeson, is a piquant reminder of the talent, musical and literary, that has always been under editors’ noses, if only they cared to look. Billed as a “challenge [to] the historic narrative of music and music writing being written by men, for men”, the contributions cross genres, decades and continents, and are less about casting judgment on artists and their work than the process of discovery and the ways music can influence and enrich lives. The best of these pieces alight on the intersection of music and identity, and how politics and personal relationships are often intertwined with our listening. The American novelist Leslie Jamison’s Double-Digit Jukebox: An Essay in Eight Mixes is built around mixtapes and reveals how the author spent her formative years experiencing music through the preferences of the men in her life, from her older brother to friends and partners. For her, music was bound up with male approval, though this changes as she forges a life and identity of her own. As a single mother locked down with her daughter in the early months of the pandemic, she listens to old songs with fresh ears and finds them transformed. The author Fatima Bhutto, niece of the former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto, reveals her childhood homesickness for a land she had never visited. This longing was passed down from her father, the politician Murtaza Bhutto, who, exiled from Pakistan and living in Syria, was forever telling his daughter that they would go back soon. He would play Otis Redding’s wistful (Sittin’ on) the Dock of the Bay, about a man far from home and Ho Jamalo, a Sindhi folk song played at weddings and parties. Music, she recalls, “carried us over the swells and tides of loneliness”. In the same essay, Bhutto also examines music as a means of resistance: Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Noor Jehan and Fela Kuti are among the artists to have stood up to oppressive regimes. “Tyrants fear music,” she observes, “because no matter their force and their power, they will never, not ever, be able to control what is beautiful.” Grief, whether for the dead or for the past, is a recurring theme, with music simultaneously offering comfort and re-opening old wounds. The London-based writer and broadcaster Zakia Sewell unearths cassette recordings of her mother, since devastated by mental illness, as a young woman singing in an acid jazz band. “She sounds happy,” Sewell reflects, “but there’s something telling in her vibrato, in the way it swells and quakes. My mother: a ghost, immortalised on tape.” Author Maggie Nelson’s vivid and heartfelt My Brilliant Friend recalls her childhood friendship with the Mexican-American singer Lhasa de Sela, stalwart of the all-female music festival Lilith Fair. Nelson had long ago lost contact with “my first and only truly bohemian friend” when she learned, in 2010, that she had died from breast cancer. Her essay is a visceral account of female adolescence and the ebb and flow of friendship as well as a moving epitaph for a complex, charismatic and sometimes maddening artist. Elsewhere, Jenn Pelly writes on Lucinda Williams’s Fruits of my Labor, describing it as “a requiem, a road song, an escape hatch, a poem”; Juliana Huxtable composes a febrile, if occasionally impenetrable, “praise poem” for Linda Sharrock, leading light of 1960s avant-garde jazz; Margo Jefferson looks at the life of Ella Fitzgerald and the multiple ways she was cruelly judged; Rachel Kushner traces the early career of Wanda Jackson before she found sobriety and God; andYiyun Litells of her relationship with Auld Lang Syne, which for her is best sung in July. Gleeson’s own essay pays tribute to the composer Wendy Carlos, the criminally overlooked brain behind The Shining soundtrack and more; while Kim Gordon has a conversation with the Japanese artist Yoshimi P-We, drummer in the Boredoms, about the purity of self-expression. If this all sounds a little serious, let me point you towards the Irish novelist Anne Enright whose Fan Girl finds her reflecting on the “beautiful disaster” that unfolded one day in New York when she met the artist and musician Laurie Anderson. Enright’s brain suddenly seemed to disengage from her mouth, rendering her incapable of saying anything other than “a single gloop of word-sentence-blurt”, which she renders as “fiffloopidiggllyblop”. She may have failed to form coherent sentences in Anderson’s presence, but she makes up for it in a lively and entertaining piece that paints the artist as a trailblazer, mischief-maker, kindred spirit and personal hero whose haircut Enright flagrantly copied. As the title suggests, the author makes no bones about being a “fan girl”, a pejorative term invariably used to separate serious male musical appreciation from music-loving girls supposedly driven by idolatry. Enright notes how she has strived to avoid what she calls “the music conversation, the one where people gather into tribes, swap favourites, judge, include, exclude, bond, claim status or coolness or an identity because of their choices. Music undoes me. It does not tell me who I am.” Judging by the other essays in this book – the title of which is taken from the Kate Bush song – you sense that Enright is not alone in rejecting musical tribalism and perceptions of what might be cool or otherwise. What binds these writers is their emotional connection to music, and their experience of songs as a portal to memories – whether painful or joyful – and a broader understanding of the world. This Woman’s Work is a collection of music writing, but in the loosest possible sense. Here, music is the soil in which all manner of stories take seed and bloom. • This Woman’s Work: Essays on Music is published by Orion (£20).

YouTube restores suspended account of Chinese vlogger reporting from Ukraine on atrocities,2022-04-07T04:17:05Z,Rhoda Kwan in Taipei,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mt7,"YouTube has restored the account of a Chinese national in Odessa who was covering the atrocities in Ukraine, a week after suspending when it received a report that it contained “suspected violence”. Wang Jixian, whose daily Mandarin vlogs detailing his life in the Ukrainian city made him an internet sensation, was temporarily suspended on Thursday last week. In his video immediately before the suspension, his video showed Chinese translations of a voice recording of Ukrainians speaking about atrocities committed by Russian soldiers. A YouTube spokesperson said: “With the massive volume of videos on our platform, sometimes we make the wrong call on content that is flagged by our community. When this is brought to our attention, we review the content and take appropriate action quickly, including restoring videos that were mistakenly removed.” Wang, from Beijing, began posting daily vlogs on his YouTube channel shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. “Today is … I am still in Odesa. I am still alive,” his videos begin. His daily updates quickly drew more than 100,000 followers but also the ire of China’s legions of nationalistic netizens. His channel suddenly went quiet last week. The programmer told his followers on Twitter that his appeal against the suspension was rejected last week. YouTube temporarily suspends reported accounts for potential violations for one week, which may be extended to 90 days if violations continue. Wang told Radio Free Asia he didn’t blame YouTube, but the “ulterior motives” of whoever reported him, saying: “where is the violence? I didn’t include photos [of violence] in my video.” Undeterred, Wang created a new YouTube channel to continue his daily updates. His new account, created last Thursday, hosts a six-day streak of videos and has already garnered 34,000 followers. Followers posted messages of relief on his new channel. “I admire your courage,” one wrote. Despite his loyal following, Wang’s support for Ukraine chafes with the narrative that China is enforcing on its citizens back home. Chinese state media has reported atrocities in the town of Bucha earlier this week as a “show” the Ukrainian side was putting on for the west, and largely portrays Russia as a victim in the conflict. The suspension followed weeks of harassment of his family members in China and the deletion of his WeChat account in mid-March. “What are you scared of? Is my voice really that terrifying?” Wang said in a video addressing WeChat’s deletion of his account."
English Heritage brings Roman town’s lost Edwardian navvies to life,2022-04-07T06:01:05Z,Mark Brown North of England correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y6nb6,"His name was Surtees Forster and he is pictured with his bucket directly in front of what was by any standards a sensational Roman discovery. That was in 1907. Nine years later he was dead, killed on the western front at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. The poignant story of Forster and other “forgotten” labourers is to be told by English Heritage in a new exhibition at Corbridge Roman town on Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland. Much is known about the Edwardian-era excavations of the site but until now little has been known about the boys and men who did the punishing physical work. The curator Frances McIntosh said she had always been struck by the people in the grainy black and white photographs who moved the tonnes and tonnes of earth to allow the excavations to happen. “I’ve always wanted to know their names,” she said. “These are men forgotten about and overlooked because they were the working men, they were in unstable, short-term contracts. They were labourers, agricultural workers, brickies … but the excavations could not have been done without these guys.” McIntosh has been sending copies of photographs to parish councils, contacting Facebook groups and using local newspapers to help find the names of the people in the photographs. So far she has managed to name 11 men and make contact with the families of three of them. The photographs have been colourised and will go on display – outside in the ruins themselves – in the hope more names can be found. “You do look back at black and white photographs and forget that things were in colour, the same as you forget there was colour in the Roman world,” said McIntosh. “You come to a Roman site and see yellow, or grey, or brown stone but actually the buildings would have been much brighter. You look at a black and white photograph from Edwardian times; that’s not what life was like, it was in colour.” Forster was one of the men identified. In the photograph he looks tiny in front of one of the most sensational finds – a stone lion attacking a goat, today known as the Corbridge Lion. Forster was just out of school, and around him were the working men who helped find it. The sense of achievement is obvious. “We know from the memoirs of one of the supervisors that the men were really proud of the work they did. When they first came they just thought of it as another job but that changed. They were men who worked in the brick factory, they were miners, they were gardeners, they became really proud of what they were doing,” McIntosh said. The men were involved in excavations uncovering objects that now make up one of the most important Roman collections in Britain. Corbridge began as a Roman military fort and evolved into a civilian settlement, which was the most northerly town in the Roman empire. Another striking photograph shows a boy cheerfully holding about six baskets. “It is such a great image,” said McIntosh. “I really think someone must know who he is, surely. I’m desperate for someone to be able to recognise him.” • Extraordinary Exploration: The Edwardian discovery of Coria is at Corbridge Roman town on Hadrian’s Wall."
Julia review – larger-than-life US cookery queen offers self-indulgent rhapsodising,2022-04-07T06:00:07Z,Peter Bradshaw,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y774n,"Here is a celebratory documentary that takes for granted throughout that its audience is already hugely invested in its subject: the American TV chef and larger-than-life personality Julia Child. She is sufficiently legendary in the United States to have rated a biopic impersonation by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie &amp; Julia and also by Britain’s Sarah Lancashire in the recent HBO TV series Julia (alongside an otherwise largely American cast). Added to which, Dan Aykroyd once did a Julia Child sketch on Saturday Night Live and David Cross in the TV comedy Arrested Development did a whooping Julia Child voice when he dressed up as a Mrs Doubtfire nanny. As for this documentary, it’s a professionally made film with reasonable things to say about the birth of TV celebrity chef culture, challenging male dominance in the professional kitchen and Child’s role in promoting the pre-eminence of French cuisine among America’s emerging food-literate middle classes. But just as with that Meryl Streep movie, I found myself restless at the parochiality of this American icon, although the film does briefly ponder the French public’s lack of interest in her. So why exactly should anyone outside the US care about Child? Do we expect American audiences to be fascinated by documentaries about Fanny Cradock? As far as UK audiences are concerned … well, why not a documentary about a Canadian TV chef? Or a Bulgarian TV chef? Or a Japanese TV chef? Of course, the American children’s TV presenter Fred Rogers – glimpsed here – was also not much known in the UK, and the Tom Hanks film from 2019 about him, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood went over well. But that had a story to tell that reached out beyond the fanbase. And without that initial fanbase buy-in, Julia feels like a redundant tribute, with something very indulgent about the “foodie” rhapsodising. • Julia is released on 8 April in cinemas."
"Having a quiet drink, I eyed a group of lads nervously … and then I saw their manbags",2022-04-07T06:00:06Z,Adrian Chiles,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7kvp,"I went for a pint with a couple of friends in a nice country pub near Lichfield. It was all rather peaceful until a posse of half a dozen or so local rascals made their entrance. They were all different versions of each other. Their haircuts were short, but just long enough to merit the application of product. Their T-shirts and trousers were all extremely tight. I hope there was an elasticated element to those jeans or what was left of their journey through puberty might be bumpy. If they were 18, I’m a Dutchman. As they lined up along the bar to buy their individual pints of lager, another aspect of their garb became apparent: strung across their skinny bodies, every one of them had a handbag – well, a man-bag or boy-bag, I suppose we have to call it. This accessorising rather took the edge off any menace they had about them and, being in a leafy part of Staffordshire, there wasn’t a lot of menace to them in the first place. They looked so sweet, their cockiness dissipating a little as they got nervous about being served. I prayed they would; I couldn’t have borne to watch them file away disappointed, handbags and all. As it was, they took their lagers over to a big table around which they sat and talked about football, swearing quite a lot. Bless them. I asked some youths of my acquaintance what the hand/man/boy-bags were all about. Apparently, they’re part of the uniform of the roadman. No, me neither. The Collins English Dictionary says the roadman is “a man who spends a lot of time on the streets in a group, and who may be involved in selling drugs”. Drugs!? Trust me, this lot won’t have had anything stronger than Calpol in their boy-bags, but it’s still good to know what their look was all about, what lifestyle they aspire to.

A simple typo means that I can’t get a vital Covid recovery pass,2022-04-07T06:00:06Z,Anna Tims,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y6th5,"I have been stuck in administrative limbo after an NHS test centre recorded my date of birth incorrectly following a positive Covid test in January. This has prevented me from getting a recovery pass. Test and trace has amended the typo but NHS Digital says that unless the date of birth was entered correctly on the date of the test, a recovery pass cannot be issued. As a result, I will be subject to stringent restrictions when I travel to Italy imminently. The Italian authorities have cancelled my vaccination pass because, according to the UK records, I have not recovered from my infection and I will therefore not be allowed to access public spaces. A Covid pass is vital to live as a free citizen and it is being denied to me because of a very minor typo. FC, Erith, Kent Given how many typos must occur at vaccine and test centres, it’s frightening to see that victims are effectively cancelled, and the authorities seemingly powerless to reinstate them. I reported a similar plight in January when another traveller to Italy was shut out of public life because her Covid pass had not been updated. In your case an 8 was confused with an 0 on your birth date. The email trail over the weeks you spent trying to resolve the problem shows you being batted between test and trace, 119 and NHS Digital, none of which seemed to have a clue how to proceed. The issue seems to be the many layers of technology at play within the NHS to match data from the various sectors. The test and trace database is only one link in the chain, and any amendments to that do not automatically flow across the other systems. NHS Digital told you it was working with “system architects” to learn how it could eliminate the typo across the organisation and enable a pass to be issued. The pioneering tone makes you wonder how past errors have been addressed. The eureka moment was achieved a couple of days after I waded in, although NHS Digital says it would have got there without press involvement. It advised anyone in a similar situation to call 119 – which you did half a dozen times over a month. Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

The UK is cut adrift by Johnson’s Brexit fantasy – when Ukraine shows the need for solidarity ,2022-04-07T06:00:06Z,Martin Kettle,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7k3m,"Two years ago, during the first Covid lockdown, Boris Johnson came face to face with a reality which until that moment he had seemed reluctant to acknowledge: the unwelcome truth that he was not the all-powerful prime minister of the whole UK. Because health policy is a devolved matter, on Covid he was prime minister of England alone. To be an effective leader, therefore, he would have to go against his instincts and cooperate. Predictably, Johnson proved to be not very good at cooperating, and as a result effectiveness suffered. The imposition and then the easing of Covid restrictions around the UK became ever-more confused and politically driven. A global health problem became entangled with Johnson’s denialism, with the narcissism of small differences between the governments, and with his increasingly chaotic management of the Tory party at Westminster. In short, Johnson himself became part of the problem of fighting Covid. Two years on, we are again witnessing something similar. This time, the challenge to good governance and effective statecraft is playing out on the European stage, not the domestic one. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Brexit had allowed Johnson to promote a foreign policy that indulged his instincts as a British prime minister of the old school as he imagined it, strutting his verbose stuff – or at least as much as international Covid restrictions would permit – as the leader of what he portrays as a newly restored and independent global power. But war in Europe has challenged that illusion head on. In the task of confronting Russian aggression and rebuilding a democratic Ukraine, the route to effectiveness also requires clear-headed cooperation and alliance-building. That’s not easy among so many nations with different interests and histories. But it means that it is more important than usual to build trust between European nations for the long term. Yet in Johnson Britain has a leader who is ill-suited to that overridingly necessary cooperative task. He is, to put it mildly, an unreliable ally. If one moment embodied this problem in visual terms it was that footage of a seemingly isolated Johnson during the official photo sessions at the Nato summit in Brussels on 24 March. For a few embarrassing moments he is apparently standing on his own, looking into the middle distance for someone to talk to among the assembling western leaders who greet one another with handshakes and smiles. Johnson’s embarrassment was only brief and should not be overstated, but the image spoke to larger realities – to the self-inflicted isolation of Britain on the world stage after Brexit, and to a level of undoubted suspicion towards Johnson among foreign governments. This is not to imply that Johnson or Britain have played an unimportant role in the Ukraine conflict so far, let alone a reprehensible one. Britain’s military support for Ukraine before and after the invasion has been weighty, important and ongoing. London is also said to be playing a significant role in pressing others to take war crimes cases to the international criminal court. And Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has repeatedly and publicly praised the UK’s and Johnson’s contributions. Nevertheless the picture is mixed. Britain was slow to impose strong sanctions, on which the pace has mostly been made by the US, which imposed further measures against Russian banks and officials on Wednesday, and by the EU, which this week signalled a ban on Russian coal and ships that may become a complete embargo on Russian fossil fuel products. Britain also continues to be a very deliberate laggard on refugees, imposing visa conditions of a complexity and severity unmatched by any other European country. Nor has Britain matched its anti-Russian rhetoric with evidence of the kind of serious long-term strategic resets on which the EU and Germany have embarked. Johnson is expected to say important things on energy on Thursday, but there is no evidence that he is driving the international effort. That is hardly surprising, since most of the key decisions on sanctions are being made by Washington and Brussels. Britain has not got a seat at those tables. This is in part the result of Brexit and in part a reflection on Johnson’s own character. In truth the two cannot be separated. Just as Johnson eventually realised two years ago that he could not make Covid policy for the whole of the UK, so today he is now almost certainly aware that Brexit is not the success that he claimed it would be. The government’s benefits of Brexit document, published in January, embodies this absurdity in more than 100 glossy pages, full of inflated claims and pie-in-the-sky speculations. By indulging these nonsenses, Johnson leaves the door open for the Conservative right to drive through a deregulatory economic agenda that will simply make things worse. But he also weakens Britain’s ability to play its part alongside those who should be its allies. The evidence of Brexit’s damage is in plain sight. This is particularly true in the UK economy, where serious labour shortages in low-skill sectors are now running into the rising cost of food caused by Covid, higher fuel prices and Ukraine-related shortages. Growth forecasts have been revised downwards, supply chains are under growing pressure, and even Rishi Sunak admitted last week that Britain’s poor trading performance might in part be the result of Brexit. Although Britain’s cost-of-living crisis cannot be entirely laid at Brexit’s door, it is indisputable that it is a significant part of the problem and, moreover, that there is no end in sight of the difficulties it is causing. The same is true of the problems over Britain’s borders, control of which was supposedly the great prize of Brexit. It seems barely to have dawned on Johnson that secure borders are only secure if there are effective controls on both sides and that this requires cooperation, especially with Ireland and France. Instead, both are treated almost with indifference. If Britain reneges on the Northern Ireland protocol or fails to implement it while insisting that Russia must respect and uphold international law, the chorus of contempt will stretch from the Atlantic to the Urals and it will be fully deserved. The tragedy, at a time when the whole of Europe has to pull together to protect its values and its freedoms against Russia, is that Britain under Johnson is, at best, failing to play the important role in this alliance for which its size and resources equip it. At worst, by continuing to play Brexit games under a leader for whom others have so little respect or trust, it may even be undermining an alliance on which, in the end, we will all depend.

‘Toxic combination’ of issues threaten world’s health and human rights – BMA,2022-04-07T06:00:06Z,Nicola Kelly,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7jtx,"Health-related human rights are under intense threat across the globe with devastating consequences for the public and healthcare professionals, a new report from the British Medical Association warned. The study, which examines the links between human rights and healthcare, identifies a “toxic combination” of emerging issues that have undermined human rights standards, putting renewed stress and pressure on populations around the world. BMA researchers say climate change, disinformation, neoliberalism, populism and socioeconomic inequalities are threatening “the vulnerable, the foreign, the marginal, the displaced, the ‘other’.” “This is a really critical moment to think through whether we’re serious about equalities in healthcare and basic universal provision,” said Dr Julian Sheather, one of the authors of the report. “We’ve got rising costs of healthcare, rising needs of healthcare and real challenges about how health goods can be distributed around the world. Globally, we’re at a turning point.” Inequalities were brought into sharp focus by the pandemic with the more powerful, wealthy countries given greater access to vaccines and personal protective equipment, the BMA said. Researchers found global cooperation had a direct impact on health outcomes, with resource-poor countries more exposed to Covid infections. Social media and other new technologies allowed governments to deliver public health messaging around the pandemic, including monitoring and interventions such as test and trace, but it also gave rise to the spread of health misinformation and increased state surveillance encroaching on the privacy of its citizens. This misinformation “undermines and undercuts” trust in the health authorities and medical opinion, Sheather said. “Populist politicians of a particular ilk have shown themselves adept at channelling their [citizens’] fears for short-term political advantage. The potential effects of these populist appeals on health-seeking behaviour can be extremely damaging,” Sheather said in the report, pointing to the example of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro’s public discourse on Covid, who called the virus a “little flu”, which should be faced “like a man, not a boy”. Conflict has also had an adverse effect on global human rights and health. The protection of medical staff and facilities during conflict are of particular concern, with hospitals and medics targeted, as seen most recently in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Medical professionals and facilities should be sacrosanct, yet we see them deliberately and systematically attacked,” Sheather said. “We need to be moving to a time of restraint and respect for international humanitarian law.” Populations who have been displaced and sought asylum in neighbouring countries or farther afield are at greater risk of poor mental and physical health, and face significant challenges accessing healthcare. The report sets out the effects forced displacement of the Roma population have had on living standards and healthcare. It shows that one in three Roma are living in housing without running water and that Roma women are 4.5 times more likely to have a low birth-weight baby than a non-Roma woman, with their babies 2.8 times more likely to be born prematurely. Research also highlights the plight of the 600,000 Myanmar Rohingyas trapped in the country, confined to camps with inadequate food, healthcare and education, and routinely subjected to state violence. Those who have fled over the border to refugee camps in Bangladesh have limited access to healthcare, and inadequate resources to support the hundreds of thousands of people living there. Climate change and its links to more prevalent diseases and virus strains, as well as the transfer of infections on migration routes, was also found to be a major contributing factor to human rights imbalances between countries. Sheather says the transfer of viruses from non-human to human hosts, as seen during the pandemic, will “continue to be a feature of climate change”. The BMA makes urgent recommendations to policymakers, including the removal of barriers for migrants to access healthcare systems and greater support from wealthier countries to displaced and migrant populations. Clear recording of human rights violations during war, with a specific list of those that relate to health and healthcare were also urged, with health professionals calling for a strengthening of the international criminal court."
Picasso portrait of lover and muse to appear at auction for first time,2022-04-07T06:00:05Z,Harriet Sherwood Arts and culture correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7kbt,"A sensuous depiction of Pablo Picasso’s muse and lover as a multi-limbed sea creature, completed during the most prolific year of the artist’s life, is to appear at auction for the first time. Femme nue couchée (Naked woman reclining) is expected to sell for more than $60m next month, a reflection of the desirability among collectors of Picasso’s images of Marie-Thérèse Walter. “Picasso’s portraits of his golden muse Marie-Thérèse are undeniable hallmarks of 20th century art,” said Brooke Lampley, chair and head of global fine art sales at Sotheby’s, which is selling the painting. Femme nue couchée was “a deeply lyrical ode to the artist’s unbound desire for Marie-Thérèse; with her fin-like, endlessly pliable limbs, the portrait continues to enchant as it perfectly captures Picasso’s muse as the ultimate expression of his genius”. Picasso’s relationship with Walter – considered one of the great love affairs of the 20th century – was for many years a closely guarded secret. At the age of 45 and unhappily married, the artist fell for the 17-year-old Walter when he noticed her through the window of Galeries Lafayette in Paris in 1927. “I’m sure we shall do great things together. I’m Picasso,” he told the teenager, who had no idea who he was. She inspired paintings, drawings and sculptures, some of which are considered the greatest works from Picasso’s eight-decade-long career. An exhibition at Tate Modern four years ago was devoted to Picasso’s output in 1932, in particular his intense portraits of Walter. “There were many notable years in the long, dramatic career of Pablo Picasso, but 1932 stands out as particularly momentous,” said Julian Dawes, Sotheby’s co-head of modern art in New York. “In this ‘year of wonders’, Picasso produced the most sensuous depictions of his great muse and lover Marie-Thérèse Walter, who would inspire some of the artist’s most iconic images.” In Femme nue couchée, Walter is depicted with the sensuous limbs of a sea-creature. She was an enthusiastic and proficient swimmer, whose grace in the water was an enduring fascination for Picasso, who never learned to swim. The lovers had enjoyed trysts by the sea in the summer of 1928, when Picasso secretly installed Walter in a holiday camp close to where the artist, his then wife, Olga Khokhlova, a Russian-Ukrainian dancer, and their son Paulo were staying. Last year, Picasso’s Femme assise près d’une fenêtre (Marie-Thérèse) sold for $103.4m at auction in New York."
Thursday briefing: Upset at Sunak wife’s tax status,2022-04-07T05:22:46Z,Martin Farrer,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ypa,"Top story: millionaire Akshata Murthy has non-domicile status Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the stories you need to know about today. Rishi Sunak’s multimillionaire wife claims non-domicile status, it has emerged, which allows her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. Akshata Murthy, who receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in the Indian IT services company Infosys, declares non-dom status, a scheme that allows people to avoid tax on foreign earnings. Murthy, the daughter of Infosys’s billionaire founder, owns a 0.93% stake in the tech firm worth approximately £690m. Tulip Siddiq, the shadow economic secretary to the treasury, said Sunak should explain how much tax his family saved while “he was putting taxes up for millions of working families”. The non-domicile status is legal and can be used to avoid paying UK tax on income from overseas rents and bank interest as well as foreign dividends. The Treasury declined to comment. A spokesperson for Murthy said India did not allow dual citizenship, “so, according to British law, Ms Murthy is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.” More than one in 10 residents of some of London’s wealthiest neighbourhoods have claimed “non-dom” status at some point, meaning they paid no tax on their offshore income. The number of people who had ever claimed non-dom status in the UK rose from 162,000 in 2001 to 238,000 in 2018. And a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the top 0.1% of earners in the UK have annual incomes in excess of £500,000, showing the effect of “unfair” tax rates available to business owners. More than 50,000 people in the top income bracket account for 6% of all earnings. * * * Ukraine latest – Volodymyr Zelenskiy says new sanctions by the west against Russia do not go far enough and will be seen by invading forces as a “permission to attack”, as fears of an assault on the east of the country intensify and civilians still there were urged to leave “while the opportunity still exists”. The deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the authorities would “not be able to help” residents who stayed behind once large-scale fighting erupted. Our reporter in Kyiv tells the heart-wrenching story of a grandfather who fears that his granddaughter – orphaned by the fighting in Mariupol – might be taken to live in Russia.

Here’s what we know so far on day 43 of the invasion, and you can follow all the latest developments at our live blog. * * * Going nuclear – Boris Johnson will launch Britain’s new energy strategy today with nuclear power at the heart of the long-term plan, but ministers have refused to set targets for onshore wind and vowed to continue the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. The strategy will enrage environmentalists, who say the government’s plans are in defiance of its own net zero targets and neglect alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills. The main points include increasing nuclear capacity from 7 gigawatts to 24GW, raising the offshore wind target to 50GW (from 11GW today), solar growing five times from 14GW to 70GW by 2035, and an “impartial” review into whether fracking is safe. * * * Cancer concern – More patients are diagnosed with cancer in A&amp;E in Britain than in other comparable high-income countries. A major study in the Lancet Oncology journal found more than a third of patients in England, Scotland and Wales discover they have the disease only once they are in hospital. People who end up in A&amp;E, sometimes after multiple trips to their GP, are less likely to survive the disease, particularly if they have stomach, bowel, liver, pancreatic, lung or ovarian cancer. * * * Conversion row – About 50 Tory MPs could force the government to toughen up its ban on conversion practices by backing a move to extend the protections to transgender people. Campaigners fighting to outlaw the controversial exercise said “the battle is definitely still on” and remained confident that No 10 would either be swayed or defeated in the remaining months. The PM said yesterday that he does not “think that biological males should be competing in female sporting events”. * * * The Swift imperium – Latin teachers are being encouraged to use Taylor Swift’s lyrics, Disney songs, Minecraft and fan fiction to help make the ancient language of Virgil and Cicero more accessible. A Cambridge academic has produced a new guide that suggests Latin should be taught more like a modern foreign language, where students are encouraged to speak, sing, perform or write creatively. Among their successes was Taylor Swift’s hit Bad Blood, the chorus to which was translated as Quod, care, nunc malum sanguinem habemus, and Let It Go (Libera) from Frozen.

More than a third of British cancer patients are diagnosed in A&E,2022-04-07T05:01:04Z,Andrew Gregory Health editor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7kef,"More patients are diagnosed with cancer in A&amp;E in Britain than in other comparable high-income countries, according to the first major study of its kind. More than a third of patients in England, Scotland and Wales only find out they have the disease once they are in hospital, the research published in the Lancet Oncology journal suggests. People who end up in A&amp;E, sometimes after multiple trips to their GP, are less likely to survive the disease, particularly if they have stomach, bowel, liver, pancreatic, lung or ovarian cancer. The International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) examined cancer data and linked hospital admissions across 14 regions in six countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway and the UK. Cancer data often has a time lag – the data was collected between 2012 and 2017 – but CRUK said it feared the outlook is now even worse after the Covid-19 pandemic. Experts at University College London looked at eight major cancers and found that more than a third of patients in England (37%), Wales (37%) and Scotland (39%) were diagnosed after being rushed to hospital. In Northern Ireland, which was measured using a different definition, emergency presentations accounted for more than a quarter (28%) of diagnoses. England, Wales and Scotland ranked worse than all other regions and countries in the study except New Zealand, where the rate was 43%. The lowest rate recorded was 24% in Victoria, Australia. “For months, we have been warning that cancer survival could go backwards due to the pandemic,” said Michelle Mitchell, CRUK’s chief executive. “The UK is already lagging when it comes to cancer survival – this study helps us understand why, showing that countries with higher levels of emergency presentations have lower survival.” She added: “If we want to build a world-class cancer service, we need to learn from comparable countries and ensure fewer patients are being diagnosed with cancer after an emergency referral or trip to A&amp;E. We’d like to see governments across the UK take bold action on this within their cancer plans so that by 2032, fewer than 10% of cancer cases are diagnosed through emergency routes.” When it comes to specific cancers, 46% of people with pancreatic cancer were diagnosed in an emergency overall, but the figure was much higher in Britain, at 56% in England and Wales and 59% in Scotland. In New Zealand, 60% of patients were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in an emergency and in Norway it was 55%. However, the figures for Ontario and Alberta, both in Canada, were 35% and 41% respectively. A total of 34% of people in England and Wales and 35% in Scotland were diagnosed with bowel cancer in an emergency, but the figure was 27% in Ontario and 32% in New South Wales in Australia. Meanwhile, 47% of people in the UK were diagnosed with liver cancer in an emergency, compared with 40% in New South Wales, 32% in Alberta and 28% in Ontario. In Norway the figure was 51%. The study found that those aged 75 and over were more likely to be diagnosed in an emergency, as were those whose cancer was advanced. Emergency diagnoses also resulted in a twofold higher risk of dying in the next 12 months compared with people who were diagnosed at other times. Cancers that often had non-specific, vague symptoms, such as pancreatic, liver, lung and ovarian cancer, were also more likely to be diagnosed in A&amp;E."
England state school pupils as happy with life as private school peers – survey,2022-04-07T05:01:04Z,"Richard Adams, Education editor",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7kdz,"Young adults and teenagers who went to state schools in England are as happy with their lives as their peers at private schools, according to a new study by researchers at University College London. The research found few differences in mental health or life satisfaction between the two groups, which surprised the study’s authors because of the substantial advantages in spending on wellbeing and support enjoyed by those at private schools. Dr Morag Henderson, of UCL’s social research institute, the paper’s lead author, said: “Although school resource is greater in private schools, the academic stress students face might be too and so we see each force cancelling the other out.” The study – published in the Cambridge Journal of Education on Thursday – is based on responses from a national sample of more than 15,000 people born in 1989 to 1990 who attended school in England, and were surveyed as teenagers and later in their 20s. “While these methods do not prove causality, the absence of significant positive effects implies that there is no evidence that parents who decided to pay for private schooling were gaining mental health and life satisfaction advantages for their children,” the authors stated. The research measured participants’ mental health by asking questions such as: “Have you been able to concentrate on what you are doing?” and “Have you lost sleep over worry?” It found little difference in responses between the two groups before and after adjusting for factors such as social background and educational achievement. Those who attended fee-paying independent schools did report higher levels of life satisfaction in their 20s. But after responses were adjusted to exclude the effects of advantages such as higher income, house ownership and better exam results, the researchers again found no substantial differences in satisfaction levels. Girls at private schools did report better states of mental health at the age of 16 than their peers at state schools but the same gap did not appear at the age of 14 or 15. The study concluded that “there is no additional advantage of private schooling with respect to mental health and life satisfaction” for the cohort it studied. But it cautioned that private schools have further increased their spending on wellbeing and pastoral support in the years since the sample group attended school. Dr Henderson said it was possible that the increased pastoral support “was just starting to make a difference” for private school pupils, who she thought might have received more support during the Covid lockdowns. “This is speculation but it might be that we see state school students fare worse in terms of mental health compared to private school students, post-lockdown. This question is ripe for future analyses,” Dr Henderson said. Earlier research among those born in 1970 found that attending a UK private school was associated with “heightened psychological distress” among women. But since the 1980s private schools have greatly increased their spending on supporting pupils."
Weatherwatch: the contrasts in Egypt’s desert climate ,2022-04-07T05:00:06Z,Stephen Moss,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y5785,"Egypt, Africa’s most north-easterly country, is one of the hottest, driest and sunniest on Earth – its desert climate inhabitable only because of the Nile River, which brings water and allows irrigation for farming. However, Egypt’s size means there is a big contrast between the climates of the far north and far south. This is epitomised by the two cities at either end of the country: Alexandria, on the Mediterranean coast, and Aswan, at the head of Lake Nasser, towards Sudan. Alexandria has a typically pleasant Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and warm winters, during which rain occasionally falls. Even so, the total annual rainfall for the city is only 235mm (less than 10 inc), which is still within the definition of “desert”. In summer, the hot wind known as the khamsin blows northwards from the country’s interior, often bringing dust and sand. Aswan, more than 620 miles (1,000km) to the south, gets a maximum of 10mm (less than half an inch) of rain a year; and sometimes none at all. Temperatures here are hot in winter, though at nights they fall into the low teens; and very hot – sometimes dangerously so – in summer, when mid-40C spells are not uncommon. The capital, Cairo, and the tourist sites at Luxor, are best visited from November to March, when the weather is usually dry, sunny and warm."
"Britain, Canada and Australia decline so far to expel Russian diplomats",2022-04-07T05:00:06Z,Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7y69,"Britain, Canada and Australia have all so far declined to expel Russian diplomats, putting themselves at odds with 15 EU nations that have now evicted more than 200 in response to the pictures of war crimes committed in Ukraine. A further 100 Russian diplomats had been expelled in the preceding two months. The British reticence to act came despite an effective warning from the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, that the west’s relations with Vladimir Putin’s Russia were over. Truss told a Nato foreign ministers’ dinner that the Nato-Russian Founding Act, the basis of cooperation between Moscow and Nato, was at an end. She said: “The age of engagement is over. We need a new approach to security in Europe based on resilience, defence and deterrence. “There is no time for false comfort. Russia is not retreating but regrouping and repositioning to push harder for the east and south of Ukraine.” Truss added that this would require a new approach to those countries that might be at risk of being ensnared in Russia’s web – Moldova, Georgia, Finland and Sweden. That may require expending more diplomatic resources to monitor and analyse Russia, and some diplomats claim expulsions of Russian diplomats from the UK will only lead to tit-for-tat expulsions from an already denuded Moscow embassy. In 2018 Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats after Moscow refused to explain how a Russian-made nerve agent was used on Sergei Skripal, a former spy, in Salisbury. Russia responded to the UK’s actions by saying the British and Russian embassies must be of equal size, requiring more than 50 British diplomats to leave. The UK does not disclose the size of its embassy in Russia, but it is known the previous expulsions stripped the UK of much political intelligence and research expertise. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, became the western leader who was most willing to articulate the case for continued diplomatic relations, saying that if Canada expelled Russians, Moscow was bound to implement reciprocal measures – thus reducing the number of Canadian eyes and ears in Russia. “I am just not sure the symbolic gesture of excluding Russian diplomats from what they are doing in Canada is worth the cost of losing our diplomats in Moscow,” he said. In the last seven days Poland has expelled 45 Russian diplomats, Germany 40, France 35, Slovenia 33, Italy 30, Spain 25, Belgium 21, the Netherlands 17, Denmark 15, Latvia 13, Greece 12, Portugal 10, Estonia seven, Ireland four, Sweden three, the Czech Republic one and Luxembourg one. Lithuania said it was expelling the Russian ambassador. The expulsions have come in two waves, some in mid-March, but a large crop after pictures of alleged Russian war crimes circulated. A continued refusal of the UK to join its European allies has already drawn criticism from the Labour party, given how much store the UK placed in the act of solidarity by other western embassies in the wake of the Skripal poisoning. Those expulsions were backed by Donald Trump, who threw out 60 Russian diplomats. In total 29 western countries expelled 145 Russian diplomats. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said he wanted to maintain diplomatic relations with the west, but pledged countermeasures. Grushko said European countries disrupting the work of Russian diplomats were damaging their own interests."

All kinds of projects will be considered, from beauty and fashion to jewellery, art and even music. The only limitation is that any end product must be small enough for shoppers to carry away from the Hammersmith store. The look and feel of the store is also likely to change to reflect the interests and ideas developed by those involved. “We want to be open to ideas,” said Camilla Henriksson, the global brand innovation manager for H&amp;M. She said the two retailers wanted to “come closer to the customers” and to local people with ideas to ensure they continued to provide what people want. Marcus Engman, the chief creative officer at Ikea’s parent Ingka Group, said the Hammersmith outlet was a year-long pilot project. If it works, further venues will be developed in other cities around the world in future. He said that the idea for Atelier100 had been under discussion for some time but was part of the search for new ideas to recreate high streets that have been hit by the pandemic and the shift to online shopping. “You can either see it as a challenging time for retail or that there has never been more opportunity for developing the future ways of retailing than right now. We try to have a positive outlook and see things will get better,” Engman said. The first 20 applicants for Atelier100, who have until 24 April to put themselves forward, will be able to begin selling their existing products in Hammersmith from next month. It is hoped that new items developed with help from the project will go on sale from October. Atelier100 has already linked up with the creative community around London by cataloguing more than 200 businesses that are designing and manufacturing products such as fashion and furnishings and the materials used to create them. The project is now attempting to spread the net wider with posters in London neighbourhoods as well as a digital campaign. “Instead of taking known routes we wanted to explore new ways to find creatives, new materials and small-scale producers existing here in London,” said Henriksson. “We see this as the start of a very exciting adventure. London is bursting with brilliant ideas and creative people, we want to meet these creators where they are. “Opportunities in arts, entertainment and recreation have been the hardest hit by the pandemic. H&amp;M and Ingka Group see this as an opportunity to engage directly with creatives and makers, to give them the visibility that they deserve and to support them in taking their business to the next level.”"
"By cancelling its LGBT conference, the government shows its lack of concern for our rights",2022-04-07T05:00:05Z,Nancy Kelley,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ek2,"This week, the government cancelled its first global LGBTQ+ conference which was meant to further equality and help tackle pressing issues like violence and hate. It did this after more than 150 other charities and community organisations from across the LGBTQ+ rights and HIV sector – including Stonewall – withdrew our support for the event. We made this choice because, after years of waiting, the prime minister broke his promise to our community to ban conversion practices for all LGBTQ+ people. In the space of just a few days, official government policy zigzagged: first a weak ban, then no ban, then finally a weak ban that only protects cis lesbian, gay and bi people, leaving transgender people out in the cold. This is in spite of the fact that trans people are one of the groups at highest risk from conversion practices. The UK government’s own research shows that 4% of trans people have been exposed to them. Last week, the LGBTQ+ charity Galop published research on abuse in the home, which found that 11% of trans people have been exposed to conversion practices by their own family. Most of the victims were harmed while they were still children. Conversion practices that target trans people are not new, they are not hidden and they are absolutely not harmless. Abuse of trans people is woven through the whole sorry history of anti-LGBTQ+ conversion efforts. Trans people were being “treated” with electroshock therapy on the NHS well into the 1970s. Today, anti-trans groups talk publicly about having a goal of “100% desistence”; or targeting trans children and young people with conversion practices until no more trans people exist. You can order manuals for conversion practices to use on your trans or gender-questioning child on mainstream websites. The harm done is acute, and sometimes lifelong. Around the world, 14 countries, from Taiwan to Canada, have already banned conversion practices nationwide, and in many others it has been banned at state level. In all but two cases, these bans cover both sexual orientation and gender identity, because all forms of this abuse are unacceptable and harmful, and because all conversion practices targeting LGBTQ+ communities have the same basic motivation. In the words of the UN independent expert: “The injury caused by conversion therapy begins with the notion that an individual is sick, diseased and abnormal due to their sexual orientation or gender identity and must therefore be treated.” An effective, inclusive ban on conversion practices is overwhelmingly supported by the British public. It is supported by the governments of Scotland and Wales, who have been clear that they will legislate and regulate to protect trans people, even if the UK government will not. It is supported by the medical establishment, including the British Psychological Society, British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, Royal College of Psychiatrists, as well as NHS England and Scotland. These professional bodies are signatories to a Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy, and are all actively campaigning for an inclusive and enforceable ban, while working to ensure their members are confident in supporting LGBTQ+ patients ethically and well. It is supported by progressive and inclusive faith leaders. Indeed, this week, in a last-ditch attempt to get the government to see sense, the former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, along with a number of religious leaders, delivered a letter to Downing Street calling for a trans-inclusive ban and stating that: “To be trans is to enter a sacred journey of becoming whole: precious, honoured and loved, by yourself, by others and by God.” And it is supported by the LGBTQ+ community. We have worked so hard across our movement to get the UK government to see that an effective, inclusive ban on conversion practices is a necessary and straightforward foundation for any country that wants its LGBTQ+ citizens to be able to live their lives freely. They have not listened and LGBTQ+ people will not stay silent. The decision to cancel the conference shows just how seriously the UK government has let down our community – our trust has been shattered. As we approach the 50th anniversary of Pride, it is vital that the prime minister works actively to begin rebuilding trust and set a clear direction for ministers to consistently support all LGBTQ+ people. That must start with a commitment to legislating for a trans-inclusive ban on conversion practices. Trans people are no less worthy of respect, compassion and protection than cis lesbian, gay and bi people. It supports all of our rights, or none of our rights.

Teachers encouraged to use Taylor Swift lyrics to make Latin accessible,2022-04-07T05:00:05Z,Sally Weale,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7jtg,"Latin teachers are being encouraged to use Taylor Swift’s lyrics, Disney songs, Minecraft and fan fiction to help make the ancient language of Virgil and Cicero more accessible to their 21st-century students. In recent decades, schoolchildren – mainly in private schools – have mastered the early stages of Latin through the tales of Lucius Caecilius, a Pompeii banker who lived in the first century AD, and his family, as described in the popular Cambridge Latin Course, soon to be published in its fifth edition. Now, however, a Cambridge University academic has produced a new guide that suggests Latin should be taught more like a modern foreign language, where students are encouraged to speak, sing, perform or write creatively, rather than just learning vocabulary and grammar from a primer. Translating hit songs into Latin, meanwhile, can enhance students’ grasp of the different techniques used in Roman poetry. Steven Hunt, who has been teaching Latin for 35 years and now trains Latin teachers, says traditional teaching methods still have their place, but is advocating a more imaginative, open-minded approach to widen the subject’s appeal. Currently fewer than 10,000 students sit GCSE Latin and they are overwhelmingly in private schools. According to a recent British Council survey, Latin is only taught at key stage 3 – the first three years of secondary level education – in 2.7% of state schools compared with 49% of independent schools. As well as making the case for “active” Latin in the classroom to engage learners, Hunt’s book details a series of innovative ways of developing students’ translation skills. In one example from a research paper, a university tutor struggling to get his students to engage with Virgil’s poetry, asked them to translate well-known songs instead. Among their successes was Taylor Swift’s hit Bad Blood, the chorus to which was translated as Quod, care, nunc malum sanguinem habemus. Elsewhere, another Latin enthusiast has recorded Disney favourites in Latin including Let it Go (Libera) from Frozen, while 3D digital modelling and Google Earth have helped students to use Latin while walking through virtual ancient sites, including a 3D model of Rome built in Minecraft. “The trouble with Latin teaching is that it’s never been subject to thorough academic investigation; we tend to rely on anecdotal information about what seems to work,” said Hunt, who hated Latin when he first studied it at the age of 11 and is horrified that he once taught Latin using texts which trivialised slavery and stereotyped female characters. “There is no ‘best way’ to teach it,” he said, “but some teachers are creating a rich set of responses to the challenge. Most draw on principles from modern languages education. Because the human brain is hardwired for sound, it learns by speaking, listening and using language. Some Latin teachers are realising that this is the way to learn any language – dead or alive.” Last summer the Department for Education announced the launch of a £4m scheme to encourage Latin among secondary state school students, starting initially in 40 schools in England, as part of a four-year pilot programme for 11- to 16-year-olds. “Latin’s role as the gatekeeper to an elite education is over, but involving more students, especially in state schools, remains a problem,” said Hunt. “The challenge for teachers in the years to come will be whether they are prepared to grasp these opportunities to present the subject differently, and widen the appeal for students, or whether they prefer to stick to familiar routines.” Taylor Swift: Bad Blood Verse 1 Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it’s all rusted Did you have to hit me where I’m weak? Baby, I couldn’t breathe And rub it in so deep Salt in the wound like you’re laughing right at me Chorus ’Cause baby, now we’ve got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you’ve done ’Cause baby, now we’ve got bad blood, hey! Translation Verse 1 Faciendumne fuit tibi hoc? Putabam me posse tibi credere. Delendumne fuit tibi quod lucidum erat? Iam nunc omnino id est robigum (sic). Pulsandumne fuit tibi in quo infirma sum? Care, spirare non potui. Confricandumne fuit altissime tibi, velut ad me rides, o sal in vulnere est! Chorus Quod, care, nunc malum sanguinem habemus. Scis id fuisse insanissimum amorem Aspice ad facta a te Quod, care, nunc malum sanguinem habemus. Ecce!"
EU divisions over Ukraine to be laid bare in No 10 meeting,2022-04-07T05:00:05Z,Patrick Wintour,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7knf,"When Boris Johnson meets the Polish president and the new German chancellor, he will see the divisions within the EU over Ukraine first-hand, and more broadly how they reflect a contest over the bloc’s future economic model. The British prime minister may find himself in contrasting roles, instinctively sympathising with Andrzej Duda’s position when they meet on Thursday, but gently restraining its rhetoric, while coaxing the naturally circumspect Olaf Scholz to be bolder, and less reactive. Poland is at the extreme end of how to prosecute Vladimir Putin for the war, while Scholz reluctantly finds himself at the other. Poland is happy to tell Germany not just that it has misjudged Putin, but that its misreading reflects a deeper arrogance in Germany. Annalena Baerbock’s inaugural visit to Poland as German foreign minister in December, her third stop after Paris and Brussels, seems a long-forgotten gesture of reconciliation. Riding high on the international admiration it has garnered for opening its arms to 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees, few of Poland’s leaders make much efforts to disguise their frustration with Scholz. Speaking to the German press at the weekend as the news of war crimes started to filter out of Ukraine, the Polish deputy prime minister, Jarosław Kaczyński – who leads the ruling national-conservative Law and Justice Party, accused Germany and France of “a strong inclination towards Moscow”. For years, Berlin did not want to see what Russia was doing under Putin. “It ended badly, as we can see now,” said Kaczyński. “But it wasn’t difficult to foresee that this would happen. But Germany always thought it knew better.” The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki – who saw the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, in Warsaw this week – has described Russia as a “totalitarian fascist state” who committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine. He then referred to Angela Merkel, saying: “Frau Chancellor, you have been silent since the beginning of the war. Germany’s policy over the past 10 or 15 years has meant that Russia now has a strength based on the monopoly on the sale of raw materials.” Germany was the main obstacle to stricter sanctions, Morawiecki told journalists. This can be seen from the minutes of EU meetings. “Anyone who reads the transcripts will know that Germany is the biggest brake when it comes to more decisive sanctions.” Some of this Polish nationalist rhetoric about Germany has, of course, existed for decades with extreme denunciations of Berlin for using the EU to create a Fourth German Reich, and impose its own rule of law on Poland. But Poland, with the UK demurely observing, has spent the past month needling Germany about its cautious approach to sanctions and to arming Ukraine. Kaczyński said: “You can’t constantly support a major power like Russia with billions in payments from the purchase of energy. This is inadmissible from a political and moral point of view. This has to come to an end, and Germany should finally take a clear stance on it.” The critical issue, he said, is whether Germany will agree to specific dates by which it will end the import of Russian coal, oil and gas. It is the oil exports, not the gas, that is the money spinner for Russia. Britain agrees, even if it says it less bluntly. Britain also sympathises with Polish plans to step up the rearmament of Ukraine in advance of the battle for Donetsk and Luhansk. Poland says it is willing to hand over its spare Soviet era T-72 tanks. It has as many as 300, 100 of which are modernised and ready to go. Some of Poland’s other ideas, such as peacekeeping mission inside Ukraine and the placing of US nuclear weapons on Polish soil, will probably make the UK Foreign Office blanch. But judging by remarks made by Truss at a Nato foreign ministers’ dinner, the UK and Poland share broadly the same analysis of the threat posed by Putin. She argued: “The age of engagement with Russia is over. The Nato-Russia Founding Act is dead, and it is time to cast off an outdated approach to handling Russia.” These remarks could well be directed at Scholz, who on Friday will be Johnson’s second European visitor this week. In reality British diplomats recognise Germany is going through a painful domestic reassessment of the foreign policy it conducted since the 80s, and whatever Britain’s frustrations with the slowness of that reassessment, it is not going to help that process if London goads or gloats. It would be foolish to belittle the significance of Germany’s decision to spend €100bn on defence. In his remarks on Wednesday, Scholz, within his rhetorical confines, could not have been clearer in denouncing Russian war crimes. Yet one G7 diplomat says: “Whether it is arms exports or sanctions, the Germans are still coming to terms with Russia’s behaviour. They start with why something is not possible, but get to the right position in the end, but it is always two weeks later than necessary.” In Germany’s defence, Robert Habeck, the green economics minister, is working on diversifying Germany’s energy sources, but it is a slow process. The Polish concern is that sometimes the slow pace seems to be driven by German industrialist’s fear that the whole economic model, built on cheap Russian energy, the basis of postwar prosperity, is now permanently threatened. Casting Johnson in the role of a diplomatic bridge builder seems implausible, but if he can persuade Poland and Germany to act more in concert that would be an achievement."
‘It always felt good here’: how Sheffield’s brutalist Park Hill estate survived the haters and their bulldozers,2022-04-07T05:00:05Z,Oliver Wainwright,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y5kee,"‘I love Park Hill because you always know when you’re home,” says Joanne Marsden. “When I come back on the train, I look up and think: ‘Wow, I’m here. I’ve made it.’” She’s talking about the colossal housing estate that stands on the hillside above Sheffield like a great concrete castle, where she was born in 1965 in her nan’s back bedroom. Her grandparents were among the first residents to move into the bold vision of 1,000 council flats when it opened in 1961, her grandad taking a job in the boiler house that heated the homes. Marsden got her own flat a few doors down when she had her first child, then moved out in the 90s when the family grew. But, after some time in London, she moved back here in 2015, into one of the newly refurbished flats in the first phase of the estate’s redevelopment. “They modernised it and put bling on it,” she says, “but I can’t say it feels any better than what it were. It always felt good living here.” Eighteen years after Sheffield city council sold the entire estate to the developer Urban Splash for £1, with the hope of seeing it refurbished in a few years, the project is about two-thirds of the way through. Almost scuppered by the 2008 financial crisis, and beset by funding problems ever since, the first phase opened in 2013; the second phase is nearly finished. It marks the completion of 450 flats, of which 20% are classed as affordable, as well as 356 student bedrooms in a third phase, which opened last year. The current state of the place – still completely derelict at one end, spruced up at the other – reads as a surreal diagram of how attitudes to postwar architecture have shifted over the years, and how an estate can be scrubbed up for sale in different ways. Designed by the architects Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith when they were in their 20s, working at Sheffield council’s architects department, Park Hill was the jewel in the crown of the Labour authority’s housebuilding boom, a dazzling essay in “the new brutalism”. It was built on the site of a cleared slum, but rather than rehousing the residents in towers, the architects attempted to replicate the tightly packed grid of the area, with elevated streets stacked to form blocks that snaked down the hillside. “It was amazing for playing out,” says Marsden. “We’d go up in the lift with our bikes, ride all the way along the street, then cycle down the hill through the middle of the estate, right back to the bottom. No matter what the weather was, you could always play out because of the covered streets.” As well as providing a fun vertical playground, the “streets in the sky” were an ingenious way of dealing with the sloping site, so you could access any floor of the building from ground level at different points on the hillside (sadly no longer the case, with access confined to a central entrance). It might look like an intransigent megastructure, but the blocks have totally different characters, as the frame adapts to the context like a concrete chameleon. At the top of the hill, it’s the scale of low-rise terrace housing, while by the time it reaches the bottom it becomes a 14-storey cliff face, the roofline remaining a constant height throughout. With a butcher and baker, doctor and dentist, as well as community centre, creche, primary school and four pubs, it was conceived as a self-sufficient hillside hamlet. “We had it all,” says Marsden. “You didn’t have to go into town for anything.” It became famous throughout the world: a 1962 book, Ten Years of Housing in Sheffield, documenting the council’s programme, was published in English, French and Russian. The story of what happened next is well told, if not always accurately. The collapse of the Sheffield steel industry in the 1980s, aided by Margaret Thatcher’s onslaught, saw mass unemployment, with many dumped in Park Hill with no choice in the matter. What had been a source of intense municipal pride became branded a sink estate, the elevated streets synonymous with muggings, drug addicts and an easy getaway for burglars. People saw it as a no-go area, a place of no hope. But that’s not how Marsden remembers it. “It wasn’t a no-go area at all,” she says. “That was just what people who had never been here said. You talked to anybody who lived here and they didn’t fear nowt. You could walk through the landings at any time of day and it was fine.” The dodgy reputation, she thinks, “was engineered to get us out of there so they could redevelop it. It was a time when people wanted access to inner-city living and they realised how valuable the site was.” Had it not been listed by English Heritage in 1998, Park Hill would almost certainly have been demolished. A second similar estate nearby, Hyde Park, was partly flattened in the 90s, its remnants horribly clad like a fridge, while a third scheme, Kelvin Flats, was erased completely. “We were the only ones stupid enough to take it on,” says Tom Bloxham, the founder of Urban Splash. He is sitting in the vegan cafe that now occupies one of Park Hill’s ground floor commercial units, dressed in a black Prada x Adidas tracksuit, with a matching hat. “When I first looked at the place online, I thought: ‘Fucking hell, that looks like a disaster,’” he recalls. “From the outside, it looked really crap. But as you get inside it, you see there is this object of beauty.” He was wooed by what residents had enjoyed for decades: the fact that every flat is double aspect; each has its own balcony and views on to green space; every one faces south. “And it has better space standards than modern so-called ‘luxury’ flats,” he adds, exceeding the now defunct Parker Morris minimum space standards even before they were adopted in the 60s. But fixing it up hasn’t been straightforward. The project had to be rescued from the jaws of the 2008 financial crisis with a £39m injection of public funding, which saw the first phase completed in 2013. Then Urban Splash had to be bailed out by the regeneration giant Places for People, with which it formed a joint venture to complete the second phase, while the student housing provider Alumno took over the third. The fourth phase, which includes a big arts centre at ground level, has planning permission, but funding remains up in the air. The first block received a mixed reception: it was nominated for the Stirling prize, but purists were aghast. Following Historic England’s “squint test” principle (that it should still be recognisable as Park Hill from a distance), everything was ripped out except the concrete frame. The rhythm of the facade was inverted, so that what once had been window became wall, and vice versa, while the subtly toned brickwork was exchanged for shimmering aluminium cladding panels in eye-searing tones of bright yellow, red and orange. The work of architects Egret West and Hawkins\Brown, it screams “Regeneration!” from every angle, a tutti-frutti billboard trumpeting the public-private asset transfer from the hilltop with garish glee. “We had to do something radical,” says Bloxham. “The perception of the place was so bad back then, we had to make a big statement. It did the job it was supposed to do – it got people talking.” Almost a decade later, the second phase of work at Park Hill – joined to the first by a trio of bridges – couldn’t be more different. From a distance, it looks almost exactly as the day the building first opened. “It’s more like how you’d treat a listed Victorian house,” says Bloxham. “More subtle and sensitive.” The brickwork has been cleaned, revealing that subtly coloured gradient from terracotta at the base, through ochre, to pale mustardy yellow bricks at the top floor, each level matched with coloured mortar. The window openings are where they were originally, only bigger and more thermally efficient. Step inside and the elevated streets feel as they once did, except the tarmac floor has been exchanged for a rubberised version, with geometric patterns cast in front of each front door, inspired by the 1970s lino doormats that residents laid outside their flats. A huge amount of work has been done to improve thermal performance, including insulating the exposed concrete beams inside the flats, after thermal imaging of the first phase revealed how much heat was being lost through the concrete frame – which can’t be clad externally, due to the listed status. “We wanted to keep as much of the building as we possibly could,” says Annalie Riches, of Mikhail Riches architects, the firm that won the 2019 Stirling prize for its pioneering low-energy social housing in Norwich. “I loved the brick from the beginning – it kind of humanises the structure, as something that’s been laid by hand. And it was in really good nick, with not a single crack.” It was a battle to convince both the developer’s project manager (“Who would want to move into the old brick one when you’ve got the shiny one next door?”) and Historic England, which wanted the estate to read as a whole. But thankfully the architects persisted. Their argument for a light-touch approach was aided by the words of Grenville Squires, who was caretaker at Park Hill for 28 years. “I think of her as an elderly lady who’s fallen on hard times,” he said of the building, when refurbishment first began. “She just wants to wash her face and put on a new frock.” While the first phase went all out with the neon makeup, Mikhail Riches has given the grande dame a more dignified makeover, with some subtle flourishes of their own. On their site visits, the architects noticed how residents used to personalise their flats by painting the brick walls outside their balconies – highlighting the individual lives within the bigger uniform grid. At the same time, they realised they would need to insulate these exposed brick walls. One observation informed the other, leading to a solution of coloured render, in 13 shades of lilac, blue and green, lining the flanks of the recessed balconies. The result is a subtle optical trick, recalling the colouring of Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation: from straight on, it looks like Park Hill always has, but, from the sides, you can make out the individual homes. Juggling the internal plans, meanwhile, turned out to be a fiendishly complex jigsaw puzzle, given that no two units are the same. “We thought we had four flat types to work with,” says Riches. “But it turned out to be 37.” Ivor Smith, one of Park Hill’s original architects, had always regretted not designing windows facing on to the raised streets, as the lack of overlooking was blamed for antisocial behaviour, but the load-bearing structure makes it impossible to cut new openings. Instead, the architects have cleverly inserted a thin vertical window next to each front door, complete with little shelves on which the new residents have already started displaying their possessions. A neat row of pot plants in the window greets visitors to the home of Craig De Gouveia, a South African software engineer, who moved into one of the new flats in January. “I’m into brutalism, and I was attracted by the ethos of the original development,” he says. “The ceilings are quite low by modern standards, but you get so much natural light up here, as well as amazing views across the city.” How does he feel about buying a flat that was built as council housing? “There’s obviously a sense of guilt that comes with it, and the conflicts of any area being regenerated,” he says. “But otherwise it would probably be derelict or knocked down. At least it’s preserved something meaningful.” Urban Splash insists that every former council tenant was offered the right to return to Park Hill, but, given that they had been rehoused elsewhere for a decade, few took up the offer. Rules in the tenancy agreement forbidding the homes’ newly raw concrete walls to be painted also put some tenants off, banned from recreating their cosy nests of magnolia and Anaglypta. “I don’t buy this nostalgic thing of the good old days when it was all social housing,” says Bloxham. “To make a place work you need to bring multi-tenure, you need to bring mixed uses, you need to bring change.” At the top of the hill stands the future final phase, the last block to be “decanted” of its tenants a few years ago, which is still technically in council ownership. It is encircled with a construction hoarding, emblazoned with the words: “We were never derelict”, from a poem by Sheffield’s young poet laureate, Otis Mensah, ironically commissioned to celebrate the regeneration. “Just displaced and out of sight,” it continues. “Carrying home inside us / When home they tried to break.” It’s a damning assessment of the council’s neglect of this public asset, but one that should be a call to arms. With more than 20,000 people on the city’s council housing register, Sheffield could take this final flank of homes on for itself and restore them to their original status – a monument to what the welfare state can do, and a beacon of municipal pride."
The Ultimatum: Marry or Move on review – absolutely terrible,2022-04-07T05:00:05Z,Lucy Mangan,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7jxf,"The last programme presented by married couple Nick and Vanessa Lachey (fixtures in the reality TV firmament for the last 10-15 years, for reasons that need not concern us now, or possibly ever) was Love Is Blind. This was (indeed continues to be, until at least 2024, as a fourth and fifth seasons have just been commissioned) a show in which strangers communicate from single “pods” without being able to see each other until various pairs profess themselves in love, become engaged, then meet and get to know one another for a month before actually-factually getting married. I remember the inaugural season vividly. I described it as “absurd, revolting, endearing, toxic and wholesome by turns – and addictive as hell throughout … Crack-meth.” I also wondered whether it would be possible to exploit emotional frailties, profane the scared, make the private and precious public and worthless and turn it into voyeuristic ratings bait any more ruthlessly or efficiently. Well, bless my little rhetorical socks – we now have an answer! The answer is “Yes, absolutely”, and it is delivered in the form of The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On. In this 10-part bin fire, the Lacheys introduce us to what is claimed to be six couples, but by my instantly anxious and fevered count, number at least 302, who have in common the fact that one of each pair wants the other to put a ring on it or else call a halt to their relationship. Shit or Get Off the Pot would have been a better title, but, alas, the US still clings in the strangest ways to its Puritan past, so to marry or move on is the decorous choice presented. I cannot possibly be expected to remember 604 – or indeed 12 – contestant names at my time of life, especially when they are all entirely interchangeable, so, instead, I have labelled them blonks 1-6A/B (the men) and blermps 1-6A/B (the women. Homosexuality has not yet entered the Lacheyean universe, although they have promised a second season with an LGBT cast). “A” denotes blondness, “B” denotes not-blondness and that is literally everything covered that matters in this show. To be fair, a couple of the blonks do stand out (Jake for being nine parts puppy and apparently as nice a guy as reality TV has ever unearthed; Colby for being the only male ultimatum-giver and for having Garth Brooks vibes even before he puts on a Stetson in the final episode). One or two of the blermps are also notable: Alexis is a flint-eyed, lantern-jawed blond who wants a ring in return for the cooking, cleaning and laundry she does for her live-in blonk (“Marriage is a financial and emotional transaction”), and April is a quick, funny, genuine charmer of 23 who should no more be wanting to get married than … any quick, funny, charming 23-year-old should. Anyway. The couples are split up and encouraged to lounge round a pool, have dinner, drink cocktails and see if they “spark” with anyone else. Then they choose a new partner to live with for three weeks before returning to their beloved, and deciding whether to shit or – I mean, marry or move on. This all goes exactly as well, which is to say as badly, as you would expect. Soon, contestants are sobbing, viewers are hoarse from screaming at the screen (the utter fury on Alexis’ face when she chisels out of Colby – during their second drink – that he doesn’t see himself marrying her lives with me still), and the Lachey/Netflix accountants are cracking open the champagne in their toxic lairs. The crack-meth blend is as potent as ever. Within 15 minutes, the lizard part of your brain is hopelessly invested and the higher functions can only pray for the accelerated heat death of the universe before the remaining nine and three quarter hours are up. It’s absolutely terrible. Morally, obviously, there is literally no justification for deliberately putting temptation in people’s way (I believe it is one of the tenets in fact of quite a few world religions). Creatively, it’s bankrupt. Educationally, intellectually it’s … not. Every other word out of every other mouth suggests we should build a pyre and place feminism atop it, for the battle is surely lost. But, oh, the entertainment. Oh, the escapism. Oh, the glory of letting hate for this and that blonk, and love for blermp 2A, who looks to be moving towards her rightful place on the arm of new blonk 6B flow untrammelled through you, washing the mental detritus of the day away and leaving you cleansed, empty and ready for the next day’s accrual of cares and woes.

Non-doms: 12% of residents in London’s richest parts claimed status in 2018,2022-04-07T05:00:04Z,David Batty,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7ftx,"More than one in 10 residents of some of London’s wealthiest neighbourhoods have claimed “non-dom” status at some point, meaning they paid no tax on their offshore income. UK-based people who have benefited from this special tax status by claiming another country as their legal “domicile” made up more than 12% of residents in two parliamentary constituencies in 2018 – Kensington, and the Cities of London and Westminster, according to an analysis of HM Revenue and Customs data. In five of the most affluent council wards they accounted for more than a quarter of residents. The study by the London School of Economics and the University of Warwick found that the number of people who had ever claimed non-dom status in the UK rose from 162,000 in 2001 to 238,000 in 2018. It found that these people were most commonly working in finance, management consultancy and accountancy, with 22% of top earning bankers having claimed non-dom status. It emerged on Wednesday that Akshata Murty, the wife of Rishi Sunak, claims non-dom status, which would allow her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. The highest earning non-doms work in the film industry and sport, likely to be famous actors, directors, producers and Premier League football players, according to the researchers. Their average earnings in 2018 were £2m, almost four times more than the income of non-dom bankers. Outside London, some of the highest numbers of non-doms were found in Oxford and Cambridge, where they made up more than 1% of the population in two parliamentary constituencies. These included 310 people working in higher education, who the researchers said were likely to be foreign senior managers and professors employed by the two elite universities. Non-doms pay no tax on income or capital gains accrued outside the UK, unless they bring the money into the country. This has allowed the super-rich, such as Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea football club, Lakshmi Mittal, the steel tycoon, and the media baron Viscount Rothermere, to avoid paying significant sums to HMRC. The study, The UK’s ‘non-doms’: Who are they, what do they do, and where do they live?, analysed the anonymised personal tax returns of everyone who claimed non-dom status at some point between 1997 and 2018. It found that non-doms made up two-fifths of top earners – those whose annual income was more than £125,000 – in the oil industry, a quarter of those in the car industry and a sixth of those in film and sports. The very wealthy were most likely to claim non-dom status, according to the researchers. More than two-fifths of those who earned £5m or more in 2018 have claimed non-dom status at some point since 1997, compared with less than three in 1,000 among those whose income was under £100,000. This trend was even greater among migrants, with 84% for those earning above £5m having claimed non-dom status at some point. One of the report’s authors, Mike Savage, professor of sociology at LSE, said the report showed that non-dom status has contributed to inequality in the UK by attracting the global super-rich to work here. He said: “What this study is really showing is that inequality in the UK isn’t just a British problem, it’s to do with the way in which rich people, who can command a high income, are working in the UK. We assume [they’re coming here] because the non-dom clause is an attractive part of the package they get here. So it’s facilitating the rise of the super rich.” More than 93% of non-doms were born abroad, coming mainly from the US, India and western Europe, especially France, Germany and Italy, the study found. The number of Indian non-doms has risen most rapidly, from about 4% of the total in 2001 (3,200) to almost 14% in 2018 (22,700). The study also found that migrant non-doms cluster in national enclaves in London. Western European non-doms are predominantly found in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea. American non-doms are most prevalent in Islington, Camden and Hackney. Those from other English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada and South Africa, are clustered around Wandsworth, Merton and Richmond, as well as in Surrey. Meanwhile, Indian non-doms reside in more suburban areas such as Harrow, Hillingdon and Bromley."
"Battle still on to protect trans people under conversion ban, say Tory MPs",2022-04-07T05:00:04Z,Aubrey Allegretti,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7kqg,"About 50 Tory MPs could force the government to toughen up its ban on conversion practices by backing a move to extend the protections to transgender people, the Guardian has been told. Campaigners fighting for Downing Street to commit to outlawing the controversial exercise said “the battle is definitely still on” and remained confident that No 10 would either be swayed or defeated in the remaining months. Insiders said No 10 was warned on Monday that they “might still lose” if the prime minister, Boris Johnson, chose to stick to his decision to water down the long-promised ban on so-called conversion “therapy”, by excluding people from it who are questioning their gender. The Government Equalities Office was also said to have estimated that if the protections for trans people were stripped out of the bill, about 50 Conservative MPs could vote to add it back in. Johnson reneged on a commitment for the conversion practices ban to cover all those who are LGBT last week, but partially backtracked in the face of a huge backlash from some of his own MPs. A government spokesperson blamed “the complexity of issues and need for further careful thought” on the decision to leave out transgender conversion practices while “separate work” is carried out. The answer was given short shrift by those who have pushed for a ban on coercive or torturous practices designed to stop someone from reconsidering their gender or sexuality, given they said intricate work on the issue had been underway for years. They also scoffed at the suggestion apparently made by No 10 earlier this week that a royal commission would be set up to examine the issue, suggesting this would delay dealing with it indefinitely. Crispin Blunt, a Conservative MP and chair of the parliamentary group on global LGBTQ+ rights, said it was “disappointing that our prime minister has yet to fully appreciate the sensitivities and complexities around gender identity as well as sexuality”. Another Tory backbencher, Elliot Colburn, said he was “extremely concerned” at the “incredibly poorly judged” decision to exclude protecting transgender people from the ban on conversion practices. “Excluding anyone from the scope of the ban sends the wrong signals,” he said. “Many other countries and territories have managed to pass these bans, we need to do the same. Fuelling the fire and giving into some kind of culture war will benefit no one.” Patrick Corrigan of Amnesty International UK said: “A ban on conversion therapy that excludes trans and non-binary people is not a real ban on conversion therapy. Human rights cannot be applied selectively.” But some Conservatives are pleased Johnson has been swayed to take a softer approach on the issue, believing that conversion practices are already prohibited by existing laws or would be too hard to ban that they would end up unfairly targeting faith leaders or medical professionals. Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, said on Wednesday that Johnson’s position was correct, and added: “We should be able to discuss these sensitive issues with mutual tolerance.”"
Look back in bhangra: Panjabi MC on becoming a pop icon,2022-04-07T05:00:04Z,Ciaran Thapar,https://www.theguardian.com/p/kgpdy,"In February 2003, the UK bhangra producer and rapper Panjabi MC played a DJ set in Germany, then flew by private jet to Switzerland to play twice more that same evening. His song Mundian To Bach Ke had recently been rereleased. Having spent five years on a closed circuit of British Asian weddings, family functions, radio shows and club nights, it would soon reach the UK Top 5 and No 1 in Italy, Hungary, Belgium and Greece. Touching down at Birmingham airport after the tour, his manager Rekha Sagoo received a call from the promoter. “I’ll always remember it,” she says. “Jay-Z had been in Switzerland and heard Bach Ke blasting through the walls and wanted to add his own verse.” The remix that soon followed (called Beware of the Boys) took the song back into the charts again in 2003, and Jay-Z performed it at Glastonbury in 2008. The success gave bhangra music a boost around the world and made Panjabi MC a household name. But many people remember him as a one-hit wonder, disregarding his vast legacy to British Asian culture, let alone his ongoing music career. “How much detail shall I go into?” he asks, sitting in his studio complex in Nuneaton. Panjabi MC, AKA Rajinder Singh Rai, is stroking a fluffy grey cat, and at 49 he has a warm presence, like a wise, mischievous uncle. After the bloody partition of India in 1947, many families emigrating from the severed region of Punjab arrived in the Midlands, where men found work in metal foundries. Rai’s grandparents settled in Coventry, where he was born. He grew up Sikh in a traditional home. “We spoke Punjabi. I had a good time. But Cov did have a skinhead problem,” he says. The National Front would mobilise after games at the football stadium, and he remembers hiding from them with his grandmother inside British Home Stores. Anger about immigration and unemployment in Margaret Thatcher’s Britain was bubbling, but so was a multicultural melting pot, and Coventry became the birthplace of the 2 tone scene that spliced punk and ska. Rai’s childhood bedroom backed on to a pub that hosted reggae bands. As he fell asleep, “all I could hear was the bassline,” he says. At community weddings, he would watch the bhangra bands set up their equipment. “I never wanted to go on the dancefloor. I wanted to be on stage.” Bhangra originated as a harvest dance from the Punjab and evolved once it married with electronic instrumentation in the UK. Prominent bands such as Apna Sangeet, Alaap, Heera and DCS toured the UK during the 1980s; so, too, did Sufi qawwali singers visiting from India and Pakistan, such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. For young British Punjabis, be they Sikhs, Hindus or Muslims, music preserved their heritage – language and wisdom via the ancient vocal scales of singers; pride in the thwack of the dhol – while Black music from the US spoke to a shared feeling of otherness among working-class migrant communities. Hip-hop filtered in from America: “We used to send someone down to London with a ghetto blaster to record Tim Westwood’s Capital radio show,” says Rai, who would bunk off school to dance at “daytimer” parties organised for young south Asians who weren’t allowed out at night. After seeing Stevie Wonder use a sampler on Sesame Street, he worked in a clothes factory to save up for “my own little lab”, which he used to deconstruct and blend the voices of his parents’ favourite singers with rap and dance music. This sampling was a hip-hop method but also an example of jugaad: the Indian method of bending rules to solve practical problems. “I loved all the original bhangra songs, but they were recorded live, so they were loose. My thing was to tighten them up,” he says. In his early teens, Rai had also practised rapping at a Caribbean social club, where others would call him Indian MC. “I told them: ‘Indian isn’t a language, it’s Punjabi!’” he says. The new name stuck. “He made music that reflected a lived experience of having multiple generations in one household,” says DJ Yung Singh, a member of south Asian music collective Daytimers and the producer of The Birth of Punjabi Garage, a new Ministry of Sound documentary. “The older generations appreciated that he sampled so much of the stuff they grew up listening to.” Apache Indian and Bally Sagoo, both from Birmingham, had developed reputations for mixing Indian music with reggae, dancehall and disco (“Bally was the guy to catch,” Rai says). Trying his own hand at forging musical hybridity, Rai fused disparate styles on his first three albums as Panjabi MC – Souled Out (1993), Another Sellout (1994) and 100% Proof (1995) – and his single Jogi would later chart across Europe. “I remember getting Souled Out and being blown away,” says New York’s DJ Rekha, whose club night Basement Bhangra, which Rai played at many times, ran from 19972017. “I’m often playing to an audience here that is not deeply familiar with Indian music – it really has to cut through. P’s production style was so different, it’s sharp to the ears.” In 1996, Rai travelled to Punjab to record his fourth album. “Someone said to me: ‘Why are you sampling these guys from your mum’s record collection when they’re still alive?’” he recalls. A friend helped track his heroes down and rented a studio in the bustling city of Ludhiana. Rai forgot his metronome, so he recorded a dripping tap on his dictaphone to keep his collaborators in time. By now, the Asian underground scene was establishing itself with artists such as Talvin Singh, State of Bengal and Asian Dub Foundation combining the myriad sounds of south Asia with UK electronica and drum’n’bass – a strong foundation for Panjabi MC’s 1998 masterwork, Legalised. It opened with Mundian To Bach Ke. Rai had sampled the theme tune from the 1980s television show Knight Rider; its tumbi riff was played by KS Bhamrah from 80s band Apna Sangeet; the vocals were by Labh Janjua, a folk singer whom Rai first collaborated with on his trip to Ludhiana. DJ and broadcaster Bobby Friction remembers buying Legalised on CD in Southall, and the euphoria of playing Mundian To Bach Ke. “I was playing all this underground stuff, but I could drop that in the middle of a set and give a nod to my roots – it was me going: this one’s for the Punjabis!” In 2002, Friction began co-hosting a show that platformed South Asian music on BBC Radio 1 with Nihal Arthanayake. After years of circulation on dancefloors across the UK, the efforts of Rai’s label head Ninder Johal combined with support from other specialist DJs such as Trevor Nelson and Tim Westwood and the fact that “every radio plugger who entered the BBC building was talking about it,” according to Friction, Bach Ke was added to the national channel’s heavily guarded playlist. Rai named his album Legalised to signal that, unlike previous releases, the samples had been cleared. But when Bach Ke started blowing up, he discovered that he didn’t have publishing rights for the Knight Rider theme. Universal Music Group took 90% of the publishing share. “We lost a lot of money,” he concedes. Nonetheless, it was a triumphant period. In 2003, Panjabi MC appeared on Top of the Pops, was awarded best dance act by MTV Europe, and won a Mobo award. Bach Ke opened the door for British Punjabi music being played not only in the UK, but across the globe, from India to America. DJ Rekha was driving through New York when she heard Bach Ke being played on the revered hip-hop radio station Hot 97. “I had to stop the car. I had a lump in my throat. I just couldn’t believe it,” she says. While Panjabi MC continued to bridge his sound with other timely genres, as on the UK garage-filled 2001 album Dhol Jageero Da, the early millennium saw a new generation of UK bhangra-inflected artists come to the fore, chart success for British Punjabi R&amp;B singer Jay Sean, and increased funding for BBC Asian Network. US producer Timbaland – who, on a visit to London, stopped by ABC Music in Southall to look for samples – drew from Indian instrumentation to make Missy Elliot’s Get Ur Freak On, while Truth Hurts had a global R&amp;B hit with the Lata Mangeshkar-sampling Addictive. “Labels suddenly thought that bhangra was the new thing,” Rai says. In his opinion, this led to saturation. At nightclubs, “I’d come on as the headline act after two or three hours’ of other acts, and by that time the crowd didn’t wanna hear more Indian stuff! They’d be like: we’ve had enough of this, mate!” He shakes his head and chuckles. “They overdid it. But people live and learn. Our kids will see where we went wrong, and their kids will see where they went wrong.” To this day, Mundian To Bach Ke holds a proud significance for many British Punjabis and south Asians. It is still a favourite across the dancefloors of continental Europe and it recently soundtracked a new commercial for German eye-wear brand, Brille Fielmann. But the song is also uncomfortable for those who saw it appropriated. “When it comes on now, people in the Asian music industry will groan. But that’s not because of the tune. The tune is powerful,” says Friction. “It’s because for years it was played whenever anything Asian came on the television – anytime someone cooked a curry on Come Dine With Me. And that took a lot of the cultural meaning away. It showed south Asians how two-dimensional the rest of society saw us.” Demand for Panjabi MC’s live shows grew exponentially after Bach Ke. “From 2002 to 2015 it just got hotter and hotter,” he says. The spread of Holi-themed festivals across Europe in the 2010s took him and his song everywhere; “I’d have 25-gig contracts in Russia sorted at the start of the year.” He has continued to make popular music, not least the global hit Moorni (Balle Balle) from his 2011 album The Raj, but Rai admits he found it hard to keep up with how software development, streaming platforms and social media were restitching the fabric of music. “Now, the race is not only with other producers in England, it’s with producers in India, too. And you can’t compete with India. There is so much music coming from there.” The country’s modernisation and the ballooning of its middle class means that a UK-based producer no longer has a technological advantage. If anything, the tables have turned. “Bhangra here has always been specialised; in India it’s mainstream. Any kid in the pind [village] can get themselves a USB stick with a million pounds’ worth of software on it for £50.” But Rai stands by the belief that the folk sound he grew up listening to will never be overtaken. “It’s like telling someone to remix Motown – forget it, the originals sound better. The analog sound is the best.” Panjabi MC’s latest single, Barood, was released on Christmas Eve, with a trademark tumbi melody and fresh trap bassline, and vocals by the London folk singer Raf Saperra, who also directed the music video. “In terms of being the man who has taken Punjabi music global, there are no three, four, five ways about it – it’s Panjabi MC,” says Saperra. “I can’t easily put into words how important his influence has been to me.” “He put us Cov boys on the map,” says Coventry rap producer Coolie. “If it wasn’t for Panjabi MC, you wouldn’t see someone like me in the UK rap scene, doing what I do.” In February 2021, he co-produced a drill anthem, Kisan, which features popular Birmingham vocalist Jaz Dhami and regional rappers like Jay1 and Temz to raise money and awareness for the farmer protests in India. The 20-year-old BBC Asian Network DJ Kizzi grew up in a household soundtracked by Panjabi MC. “For both my parents he was like the godfather,” she says, adding that “he’s one of the only artists who has adapted himself to the younger generation.” “I never thought bhangra music from England was going to be listened to by people who don’t even understand it,” Rai concludes. “When I was watching Blue Peter when I was 16 years old, I thought: one day, I’m gonna be abseiling down mountains, parachuting, watching football in stadiums, behind a speedboat, waterskiing … I ain’t done none of that. I spent my time in labs like this. But now I know my music.” Our interview finishes and Rai invites me into a room where his friends have gathered on sofas for a drink. He puts on a video of Stevie Wonder performing live and makes everyone stop talking to listen. As I leave, the instrumental for Tupac’s Hail Mary is blasting from a soundsystem. Someone has picked up a tumbi to improvise a corresponding melody, and Panjabi MC has started freestyling again."
Country diary: A little egret does its best impression of a gull,2022-04-07T04:30:03Z,Derek Niemann,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y68mq,"A shapeshifting bird has descended on our stretch of the River Ivel. It turns heads, commands attention, and fits the descriptions of both dainty and dumpy. My eyes lifted the other day from a pair of swans scudding across the mill pool towards the far side, where the river resumes its narrowed course. There was white beyond white, a little egret poking around the margins with such assurance and precision that it reminded me of a decisive shopper – one of those, one of those and, yes, I’ll take two of those. Over the winter, egrets were jittery, flighty visitors here, apt to lift off and swirl in agitation whenever I came into view. But this one, closer than any hitherto, once I had walked along the bank to confront it, was unfazed. Egrets do dainty. Moments earlier, its elfin figure, slight and slender, light on Marmite-dark pins, gave a twist of the head, a flick to the left, nod to the right. Poke, prod, jab. And then up it rose, flapped a little way, before settling as a no-neck dumpy heron. A row of birds perched on the river-spanning cage around a gas pipe: a sentry line of three black-headed gulls with chocolate heads, plus now the egret tagged on the end. I’d never seen any other bird share the gulls’ stance before, but they looked unbothered, maybe because the taller egret immediately shrank into itself so that it was just one of the gulls. Members of the heron family have a tendency towards habitual behaviour, and it wasn’t a complete surprise to find the egret on the same perch 24 hours later. The gulls were gone. The bird, exposed and hunched, eyed a man and a dog who were walking the bank towards it. The egret turned its head by degrees to see them off. Just then a light breeze arose, ruffling the compact shape, lifting a nuptial plume briefly from its nape as if it were a curl out of place. Was this one of a breeding pair, perhaps? • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"
 Zelenskiy says Kremlin forces are trying to cover up evidence of atrocities – as it happened,2022-04-06T04:40:17Z,"Samantha Lock (now); Maanvi Singh, Gloria Oladipo, Tom Ambrose, Rachel Hall and Martin Belam  (earlier)",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7t37,"Thank you for joining us for today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. We have moved our liveblog across to the page below where you can follow all the latest developments. Shortly, we will launch a new liveblog to continue our coverage on the war in Ukraine. But before we do here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand: Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. In his daily address on Thursday, he called for the democratic world to reject Russian oil and completely block Russian banks from the international finance system. Zelenskiy said the west’s hesitation to agree on an oil embargo is costing Ukrainian lives. Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously, he added. The US, UK and EU unveiled new sanctions against Moscow. US sanctions target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia as well as sanctions on Putin’s adult daughters. The UK will impose an asset freeze on Russia’s largest bank, place sanctions on eight more oligarchs and end imports of oil and coal by next year, foreign secretary Liz Truss said. The EU announced a wide-ranging package of sanctions, including import bans on coal and transaction bans on banks. Nato’s foreign ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday for two days of talks on bringing an end to the war. The UN General Assembly will vote today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Hungary’s right-wing, Putin-allied prime minister Viktor Orbán gave a press conference in which he said he had offered to broker talks with Russia. He offered to work towards a ceasefire, while stopping short of agreeing to extend EU sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas shipments. Zelenskiy said Kremlin forces were trying to cover up evidence of atrocities. “We have information that the Russian military has changed its tactics and is trying to remove people who have been killed from streets and basements ... this is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more,” he said Thursday, but did not provide evidence. US prosecutors are working with their European and Ukrainian counterparts to help collect evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Russia’s military has now shifted its focus to the east of the Ukraine, with Ukraine authorities in Luhansk and Donetsk warning that civilians should leave “while the opportunity still exists” before a massive Russian military assault that it expects in the coming days. It comes as western officials say Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could go to Donbas and perhaps longer. Russia is hiding ‘thousands’ killed in Mariupol, Zelenskiy said. Russian forces are blocking humanitarian access to the besieged port city of Mariupol because it wants to hide evidence of “thousands” of people killed there, the president said. More than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since the start of Russia’s invasion, the mayor of the besieged city said. Vadym Boichenko said 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed and Russian forces have targeted a hospital where 50 people were burned to death. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to access the city, about 1,000 people made it out of Mariupol in a convoy of buses and private cars organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They are now at the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia. A total of 4,892 people were evacuated from Ukraine on Wednesday using humanitarian corridors, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, compared with 3,846 who were evacuated on Tuesday. Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the US to operate deadly Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Defence department spokesman John Kirby said it was a “very small” number of Ukrainian troops who were already in the US before Russia invaded their country. Britain is drawing up plans to send armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to The Times. Options include sending a protected patrol vehicle, such as the Mastiff, or a vehicle like the Jackal, which can be used as a reconnaissance or long-range patrol vehicle, a ministry of defence report said. Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a “good understanding” of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, US deputy secretary of state said. The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.” Here are some of the latest images to come from Ukraine today. In Bucha, two young girls walks hand-in-hand past destroyed Russian military machinery littering the main town street. A child’s teddy bear hangs from a tree in front of a building bombed by the Russian army in Borodyanka while a damaged playground is seen next to a heavily damaged apartment building in Hostomel. Italy will “follow the decisions of the European Union” on new sanctions against Russia, including a possible gas embargo, prime minister Mario Draghi has said. The growing number of “massacres” in Ukraine “is prompting us to adopt even tougher sanctions,” he told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. All the allied countries are wondering what can be done to stop Russia... We are following what the European Union decides. If we are offered a gas embargo, we will follow the EU down this path, we want the most effective instrument to achieve peace.” While a gas embargo is “not a possibility being discussed at the moment” the situation is “constantly evolving” Draghi added. Italy is highly dependent on Russian gas, importing 95% of the gas it consumes, of which around 40% comes from Russia. “Today the gas embargo is not yet... on the table,” Draghi said. The UN General Assembly will vote today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. The move was initiated by the United States in response to the discovery of hundreds of bodies after Russian troops withdrew from towns near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, sparking calls for its forces to be tried for war crimes. US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the 47-member council in the wake of videos and photos of streets in the town of Bucha strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians. “We believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce.” While the Human Rights Council is based in Geneva, its members are elected by the 193-nation General Assembly for three-year terms. The March 2006 resolution that established the Human Rights Council states that the assembly may suspend membership rights of a country “that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.” To be approved, the resolution requires a two-thirds majority of assembly members that vote “yes” or “no.” Abstentions don’t count. The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.” Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr. Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine. He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state. And he’s really only taken control of a small number of population centres. And even they weren’t the ones that he was really going after. So, you know, Mariupol is still not taken. He’s moved his forces out of Kyiv. He’s moved his forces out of Cherniniv. They haven’t taken Kharkiv. They haven’t taken Mykolayiv in the south. So, I think the proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing every day. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting for their country. And they have denied Mr. Putin so many of his strategic objectives. So absolutely, they can win.” Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a “good understanding” of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, US deputy secretary of state has said. Wendy Sherman, while speaking at a House of Representatives foreign affairs committee hearing on Wednesday, said the “range of sanctions” and export controls coordinated among US allies and partners against Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country’s economy, and oligarchs, should serve as an example for China’s leader Xi Jinping. It gives President Xi, I think, a pretty good understanding of what might come his way should he, in fact, support Putin in any material fashion.” She said Beijing should “take away the right lessons” from the coordinated western response over Ukraine that any moves by China to take the democratically governed island of Taiwan by force would not be acceptable. “We hope that the PRC understands that any such action would see a response from the international community, not just from the United States,” she said, referring to the People’s Republic of China. China has refused to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine or call it an invasion and has criticised Western sanctions on Moscow, although a senior Chinese diplomat said last week that Beijing is not deliberately circumventing those sanctions. Zelenskiy maintained that alleged atrocities committed by Russian forces in Bucha would be repeated in other cities, this time with Russia hiding the evidence of any crimes. We have information that the Russian troops have changed their tactics and are trying to remove the killed people from the streets and basements of the occupied territory. Killed Ukrainians. This is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more. However, the president remained optimistic that they would not succeed. “Responsibility cannot be avoided,” he added. We already know about thousands of missing people. We already know about thousands of people who could be either deported to Russia or killed. There are no other options for their fate. The situation now is that thanks to an objective investigation, thanks to witnesses, thanks to satellite surveillance of events on earth, thanks to other tools that help establish the truth we will find out all the circumstances regarding the majority of our missing citizens. Regarding most of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine.” “The search for truth can no longer be stopped,” he added. Zelenskiy described Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously. Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros to Russia from the oil trade, so as not to jeopardise their own economies... The embargo on Russian oil supplies will be applied anyway. The format will be found. The only question is how many more Ukrainian men and women the Russian military will have time to kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, can borrow a little determination somewhere.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine will also continue to insist on a complete blockade of the Russian banking system from international finance. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. New investments in Russia are blocked, restrictions are applied against several systemic banks in Russia, personal sanctions are added, as well as other restrictions. This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough.” In his signature nightly national address the Ukrainian president added: If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons we really need and have applied for many times, it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to go further. A permission to attack. A permission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas.” However, Zelenskiy remained optimistic saying “it is still possible to prevent this”. It is still possible to impose such sanctions, which Ukraine insists on, our people insist on. It is still possible to give us weapons that will really stop this aggression. The west can do it. Just as it could have applied preventive sanctions last year to prevent this invasion. If the mistake is made again, if there is no preventive action again, it will be a historic mistake for the whole western world.” Britain is drawing up plans to send armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to The Times. Options under consideration include sending a protected patrol vehicle, such as the Mastiff, or a vehicle like the Jackal, which can be used as a reconnaissance or long-range patrol vehicle, a ministry of defence report said. The vehicles would be stripped of sensitive equipment and British troops would be sent to a country neighbouring Ukraine to carry out training, the newspaper reported, citing a defence source. Further support, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, would be announced by Britain in the coming days, the report said. Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the United States to operate the deadly Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv, a Pentagon official said Wednesday. Defence department spokesman John Kirby said it was a “very small” number of Ukrainian troops who were already present in the US before Russia invaded their country. Speaking at a brief briefing on Wednesday, Kirby said the weapons were not a system that the Ukrainians typically use. So, there is going to need to be a little bit of training. It is not a very complex system. It doesn’t require a lot of training ... We took the opportunity to - having them still in the country, to give them a couple of days’ worth of training on the Switchblade. So that they can go back ... back home to train others in the Ukrainian military. And we’ll look at - that doesn’t have to be the end all of it. I mean, we’ll look at other suitable opportunities, if needed to provide more training on the Switchblades if it’s necessary, but that’s what they were referring to yesterday.” Kirby said the 100 drones, which are essentially remotely controlled flying bombs which are crashed into targets where they explode, have been sent to Ukraine to bolster the military’s fight against Russian troops. “They arrived over there earlier this week. So they’ll be getting into Ukraine quickly if they aren’t already there,” Kirby said, adding that the number of Ukrainian trainees was less than a dozen. President Joe Biden announced on 16 March that, among other weaponry and munitions Washington was shipping to the Ukrainians, it would start sending the Switchblades. Named for the way their wings unfold when launched, Switchblades are called loitering munitions, because they can be flown to target areas and held there until the right moment when a target is identified. The operator then flies them into the target where they explode. The original version, small enough to carry in a backpack, was used by US forces in Afghanistan. A larger version, with enough explosives to take out armoured vehicles, has also been developed. But the Pentagon would not say which one has been sent to Ukraine, if not both. Meanwhile the United States announced Tuesday it was releasing another $100 million worth of military aid to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine was clearly a miscalculation, and will shorten his time in office, a top ally of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has said. “Very clearly, Putin has shortened his term,” Leonid Volkov told AFP in an interview. With his decision to invade Ukraine, “Putin has dramatically decreased the probability of a scenario where he just stays in the Kremlin until he dies ... as he planned.” Speaking on the sidelines of the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, Navalny’s right-hand man said it was becoming increasingly obvious that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine six weeks ago was “miscalculated” and doomed to failure. Volkov acknowledged that Putin so far was “doing OK in selling his propaganda narrative” justifying the invasion to those in the Russian public who receive all news about the war from state-controlled television. But he stressed that elites were “very unhappy with the economic devastation, the casualties and restrictions and sanctions”. “They will start thinking of regime change, or changing systems.” Russia is blocking humanitarian access to the besieged port city of Mariupol because it wants to hide evidence of “thousands” of people killed there, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. In an interview with Turkey’s Haberturk TV, he said: I think Russia is afraid that [if] we successfully send humanitarian aid to Mariupol, then the whole world will see what’s going on here. Russia doesn’t want anything to be seen until they take control of the city until they clean it all up. Mariupol is hell right now. Thousands have either been killed or injured. The number of those killed and injured is increasing day by day ... we do not have clear information on the number of those who lost their lives. They are trying to cover up the situation. In this case, they are trying to prevent the humanitarian supply. They will not be able to cover up everything. They will not be able to bury or hide thousands of people. The world has seen the real situation. It has seen what has been done to a Ukrainian city.” Zelenskiy said that Russia had already attempted to conceal evidence of crimes in the town of Bucha outside of Kyiv and several nearby communities, where Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of carrying out widespread killings of civilians. “They burned families. Families. Yesterday we found again a new family: father, mother, two children. Little, little children, two. One was a little hand, you know,” Zelensky said. “That’s why I said ‘they are Nazis’.” US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said Russia should be expelled from the Group of 20 major economies forum, and the United States will boycott “a number of G20 meetings” if Russian officials show up. Her comments at a US House Financial Services Committee hearing raised questions about the G20’s future role in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Yellen told lawmakers that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the killings of civilians in Bucha “are reprehensible, represent an unacceptable affront to the rules-based global order, and will have enormous economic repercussions in Ukraine and beyond”. The United States and its key allies have placed greater emphasis in recent months on the G7 grouping of industrial democracies, whose interests are more aligned, using G7 meetings to coordinate their response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Yellen said that the Biden administration wants to push Russia out of active participation in major international institutions, but acknowledged that it was unlikely that Russia could be expelled from the International Monetary Fund given its rules. “President Biden’s made it clear, and I certainly agree with him, that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in any of the financial institutions,” Yellen said in response to a question. “He’s asked that Russia be removed from the G20, and I’ve made clear to my colleagues in Indonesia that we will not be participating in a number of meetings if the Russians are there,” Yellen said. The US has disrupted a global “botnet” controlled by Russia’s military intelligence agency, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Wednesday. A botnet is a network of hijacked computers used to carry out cyberattacks. “The Russian government has recently used similar infrastructure to attack Ukrainian targets,” Garland told reporters at the justice department. “Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used. Thanks to our close work with international partners, we were able to detect the infection of thousands of network hardware devices. “We were then able to disable the GRU’s [the military intelligence agency] control over those devices before the botnet could be weaponised.” The attorney general also announced charges against Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev for sanctions violations. He said the billionaire had been previously identified as a source of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and providing support for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine. “After being sanctioned by the United States, Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to surreptitiously acquire and run media outlets across Europe,” Garland said. The indictment is the first of a Russian oligarch in the US since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In a related move, a federal court in the southern district of New York unsealed a criminal indictment against TV producer John Hanick, 71, a US citizen charged with violations of sanctions and false statements because of his work for Malofeyev over several years.

US sanctions target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia as well as sanctions on Putin’s adult daughters. The UK is collaborating with the US on asset freezes against Russian banks and banning all new outward investment to Russia. And the EU announced a wide-ranging package of sanctions, including import bans on coal and transaction bans on banks. Hungary’s right-wing, Putin-allied prime minister Viktor Orbán gave a press conference in which he said he had offered to broker talks with Russia. He offered to work towards a ceasefire, while stopping short of agreeing to extend EU sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas shipments. Russia’s military has now shifted its focus to the east of the Ukraine, with authorities in Luhansk and Donetsk warning that civilians should leave as quickly as possible. There were reports of burning buildings in Luhansk following Russian shelling, with casualties unknown; while five were killed in Donetsk, according to the governor; and Ukrainian railways reported rocket fire on a railway station in the east of the country, which resulted in casualties, though gave no further detail on the location or number of victims. Western officials said Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could move to Donbas. Kyiv reported 89 deaths since the start of the conflict. More than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the mayor of the besieged city. Mayor Vadym Boichenko said 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed and Russian forces have targeted a hospital where 50 were burned to death. Russian attacks on the port city have obstructed access to food and supplies and Red Cross humanitarian convoy has been unsuccessful in getting in. Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an impassioned speech to Ireland’s parliament, in which he urged the country to pile extra pressure on EU nations to introduce tougher sanctions, accusing European countries of worrying excessively about the economic consequences. – Rachel Hall, Guardian staff Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said that international experts need to work with Ukraine to “ensure that sanctions are sufficiently destructive” to Russia. “The war continues. Everyone saw the horrors that took place in the city of Bucha. And that means sanctions are not enough to stop Russia,” he said. “Therefore, all of us and our partners need to work to ensure that sanctions are sufficiently destructive.” Rostyslav Shurma, the deputy head of office, also said that Russia should be internationally recognized as a “sponsor of terrorism” and included in the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental group designed to combat money laundering, to restrict trade, according to the Ukrainian president’s office. Ukrainian officials have been meeting with international experts – including former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul – to discuss sanctions and actions against Russia. Russia is inching closer to a default on its debts. Reuters reports: Russia edged closer to a potential default on its international debt on Wednesday as it set aside roubles to pay holders of international bonds that need to be repaid in dollars and said it would continue to do so as long as its foreign exchange reserves are blocked by sanctions. The United States on Monday stopped Russia from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600 million from frozen reserves held at U.S. banks, saying Moscow had to choose between draining its dollar reserves at home and default. Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since reneging on payments due after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, but its bonds have remerged as a flashpoint in the diplomatic crisis and sanctions tit-for-tat between Moscow and western capitals. “This speeds up the timeline around when Russia runs out of space on willingness and ability to pay,” one fund manager holding one of the bonds due for payment on Monday said. The Kremlin said it would continue to pay its dues. “Russia has all necessary resources to service its debts... If this blockade continues and payments aimed for servicing debts are blocked, it (future payment) could be made in roubles,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Moscow has managed to make a number of foreign exchange coupon payments on some of its 15 international bonds with a face value of around $40 billion outstanding before the United States stopped such transactions. While sanctions have frozen roughly half of $640 billion in Russia’s gold and foreign currency reserves, the country still receives billions of dollars from exporting crude and gas. The identities of Putin’s daughters have never been confirmed by him or the Kremlin and no photographs of them as adults have ever been officially released. Even the number of children Putin has fathered is subject to intense speculation. Officially, Putin has two children, Maria and Katerina, from his marriage to Lyudmila Putina, a former Aeroflot steward whom he divorced in 2013, becoming the first Russian leader to divorce since Peter the Great in 1698. Putin, who has very rarely spoken publicly about his children, responded to questions at his annual press conference in 2015, saying his daughters had not fled the country, as had been speculated. “They live in Russia. They have never been educated anywhere except Russia. I am proud of them; they continue to study and are working,” he said. “My daughters speak three European languages fluently. I never discuss my family with anyone. “They have never been ‘star’ children, they have never got pleasure from the spotlight being directed on them. They just live their own lives.” Putin said his daughters were “taking the first steps in their careers”, and were “not involved in business or politics”. However, both daughters have since launched business ventures. Read more: As the war in Ukraine enters a new phase, Nato countries have been gradually stepping up their supply of weapons to Kyiv. In doing so, western nations are quietly crossing the defensive-only threshold set by leaders at the start of the crisis. But the question remains whether the gradual escalation in arms deliveries can avoid a Russian retaliation and turn the tide on the battlefield, where Moscow is seeking to wage a more conventional military-on-military war in the eastern Donbas. “The issue will be how much the west shifts to offensive weaponry,” said Phil Osborn, a former UK chief of defence intelligence, “and the absolute criticality of ensuring that the supply of critical military kit is maintained and increased.” Ukraine’s military spent the first six weeks of the war trying to pick off invading Russian armoured columns with light infantry using anti-tank bazookas. Poor Russian tactics and Ukrainian determination successfully forced the overstretched attackers to abandon their attacks on Kyiv, and Chernihiv and Sumy in the north-east. But Ukraine now has to deal with Russian forces in the east and south that have made more defensible gains and are better dug in. In the past 24 hours it has emerged that the Czech Republic has sent a dozen Soviet designed T-72 tanks, plus howitzer artillery pieces and BMP-1 armoured vehicles, a significant shift in the direction of supplying “offensive weapons” that western politicians had insisted they were not prepared to do. That by itself is not enough to make more than a dent in the 94 tanks that Ukraine is estimated by researchers at Oryx to have lost in the fighting so far – but there is persistent speculation Poland could spare 100 more, now it has reached a separate agreement on Tuesday to buy 250 US Abrams tanks for $4.75bn. The next phase of the war – which could yet be decisive – is expected to unfold in the Donbas in the next month as Russian forces seek to capture Mariupol, create a land bridge to Crimea, expand the area of occupation in the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk – and perhaps encircle Ukraine’s main fighting force ranged against it. Read more: In France, president Emmanuel Macron is defending his diplomatic efforts with Vladimir Putin, as he faces a challenge from the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. Le Pen, who is gaining in polls ahead of the the first round of voting in France’s election on Sunday, and who had previously expressed admiration for Putin and lobbied for the EU to drop sanctions against Russia after the annexation of Crimea, has sought to distance herself from Moscow ahead of the elections. Macron, responding to Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawieck’s criticisms of his meetings with Putin, accused Morawieck of seeking to bolster Le Pen. AFP reports: Morawiecki on Monday slammed Macron’s hours of phone calls with Putin, whom he likened to Hitler, and suggested they had achieved nothing. “These statements are both baseless and scandalous,” Macron told TF1 on Wednesday evening when asked about the remarks which threaten to undermine EU unity during the bloc’s face-off with Moscow over Ukraine. He said the Polish leader was from a “far-right party” and was “supporting” his rival Marine Le Pen in France’s presidential election this month. “I take full responsibility for having spoken to the president of Russia, in the name of France, to avoid the war and to build a new architecture for peace in Europe several years ago,” he added. “I did it from the beginning of my term in office,” he said adding: “I was never naive, unlike others. I was never complicit, unlike others.” Macron has sought to target Le Pen’s links to Russia, stressing repeatedly how she had taken a loan from a Russian bank which her National Rally party is still repaying. Jessica Elgot and Jasper Jolly report: The Russian billionaire Moshe Kantor, who was sanctioned by the UK government on Wednesday, has long cultivated deep ties with British politicians and establishment figures, including Tony Blair and Prince Charles. With an estimated net worth of £3.48bn, Kantor is the largest shareholder in the fertiliser company Acron, which the Foreign Office said had vital strategic significance for the Russian government. But in Europe Kantor is best known as the holder of one of the Jewish community’s most high-profile roles, president of the European Jewish Congress (EJC), as well as his multitude of interests in Jewish charities, education and events. Born in Moscow and now a British citizen, Kantor, 68, has maintained close ties to Vladimir Putin, and has brought a number of delegations to meet the Russian president, according to Haaretz. In 2017, Putin bestowed Kantor with the Order of Honour “in recognition of his professional achievements and longstanding fair work”. The Kantor Centre, which the billionaire founded in Israel, has condemned Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. In 2015, Kantor appointed Tony Blair to a role tackling antisemitism as chairman of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, an organisation funded and founded by Kantor. Blair is still listed as a chair of the organisation, along with the former Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Kantor is vice president of the Jewish Leadership Council and honorary life president of a school in Ilford, east London, Kantor King Solomon, jointly with The Apprentice tycoon Lord Alan Sugar. He also organised the World Holocaust Forum, which marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, attended in Jerusalem by Prince Charles, Macron, then US vice-president Mike Pence and Putin. The Kantor Centre, which he founded at Tel Aviv University, issued a statement condemning the war in Ukraine as an “unprovoked invasion … and the cowardly war crimes committed under the directives of Vladimir Putin”. It said the Russian invasion was “fascist-style aggression” and added: “Putin has the blood of thousands of victims, including children, on his hands. His policies pose an existential threat to world democracy, peace and security.” The EJC said it was “deeply shocked and appalled by the decision” to impose sanctions on Kantor, adding: “Dr Kantor has been granted the most prestigious awards and honours from many European heads of state and government. We call for this decision to be reversed as soon as possible.” Read more: Here’s more context on how additional sanctions targeting the daughter of Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, will affect her, from the Washington Post’s Paul Sonne: Lavrov’s daughter, who was sanctioned by Treasury today, was born in the US, went to school at the private Dwight School in New York and graduated from Barnard. This will have a substantive impact on her life. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said today that the US will impose additional sanctions against the adult children of Russian president and other Russian officials, as well as their relatives. From Blinken’s Twitter account: We are implementing sanctions on two of the largest Russian financial institutions, designating the adult children of President Putin, the wife and adult child of Foreign Minister Lavrov, and 21 members of Russia’s National Security Council, including former President Medvedev. An update on the convoy of civilians leaving the besieged city of Mariupol: an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) team has led a bus of more than 1,000 people to Zaporizhzhia. Earlier reports from today said the convoy was escorting more than 500 citizens, but a new report from Reuters updated the figure to over 1,000 people. A small number of Ukrainian soldiers received drone training in the US, said the Pentagon today, reported AFP. A small group of Ukrainian soldiers who were already in the United States before Russia’s invasion of their country are being trained to use the deadly Switchblade drones Washington is supplying to Kyiv, a Pentagon official said Wednesday. “A very small number of Ukrainians... were already here in the United States going through some professional military education,” the senior defense official said, requesting anonymity. “We took advantage of the opportunity to pull them aside for a couple of days and provide them some training, particularly on the Switchblade (drones) that is a system that is not organic to the Ukrainian military,” he said. The group, made up of “less than a dozen” people, “will be heading back into Ukraine relatively soon” as originally planned, he added... A total of 4,892 people have been evacuated from Ukraine today using humanitarian corridors, reports Reuters. In an online post, Ukraine deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that a total of 4,982 people had escaped from multiple Ukrainian cities, compared with 3,846 who were evacuated on Tuesday. The mayor of Mariupol said today that over 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reports the Associated Press. Today, Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko confirmed the amount of Mariupol civilians that have died since the start of Russia’s occupation. Boichenko noted that Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death. Boichenko also said that more than 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed due to Russian bombardments. The Russian military has besieged the port city, cutting off access to food, water and energy supplies while continually dropping artillery and air raids on the town. Read AP’s full story here. Shells and rockets were landing at regular intervals in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk today, reports AFP. According to AFP journalists who observed the bombardment, one building caught on fire during the bombing. Civilians who were outside quickly ran for cover as the shelling continued. “We have nowhere to go, it’s been like this for days,” said Volodymyr, 38, to AFP. Volodymyr was on the opposite side of the road to a burning building. Today, amid increased fighting, Ukraine warned civilians in the eastern parts of the country to leave the area “while the opportunity still exists”, citing a massive Russian military assault expected in the coming days. Ukraine deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said: It has to be done now, because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it ... It is necessary to evacuate as long as this possibility exists. For now, it still exists. US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said today that sanctions imposing a full ban on Russian oil would probably cause “skyrocketing” prices felt globally, reports Reuters. US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday that sanctions imposing a full ban on Russian oil exports would likely result in “skyrocketing” global prices that would hurt the United States and its democratic allies. Yellen told the US House financial services committee she hopes oil companies in the United States and elsewhere can ramp up production in the next six moths, enticed by higher prices, which may allow for tougher restrictions on Russian oil. French president Emmanuel Macron said today that the killings in the Ukrainian city of Bucha were “very probably a war crime” that deserved justice, Reuters has reported. During remarks today, Macron condemned the killings in Bucha, saying: It was very probably a war crime that was committed there. Macron also said that he was in favor of additional sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine and several western countries have accused Russian forces of killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha during its occupation, an allegation that Russia denies. Ukraine cannot help evacuate residents in the eastern town of Izyum, which is currently under Russia control, reports Reuters. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said today that Ukraine officials could not help people evacuate Izyum or send humanitarian aid to the town because it was completely under Russian control. Fighting in the eastern regions of Ukraine has escalated after Russia withdrew troops from around Kyiv, Reuters further reported. The parents of Trevor Reed, a US ex-marine who is jailed in Russia, said today that they are concerned “something terrible” has happened to their son, reports Reuters. Reed’s parents say that they have not received any updates on him in the past five days, despite his “rapidly declining health.” A statement from Reed’s parents read, in part: It has now been five days without any updates at all on Trevor’s rapidly declining health and with each passing hour, we are more and more worried that something terrible has happened. On Monday, Russian news agencies reported that Reed had ended a hunger strike that he had begun to protest against being put in solitary confinement and not receiving proper treatment for a possible tuberculosis diagnosis. Russian media also reported that Reed was being treated at the prison’s medical facility. Today, Reed’s parents said that they had not been able to confirm if Reed was actually taken to the medical facility or even ended his hunger strike. They said further that they had no confirmation that Reed was receiving “any real medical care as Russian officials have claimed”. The FBI said today that it had stopped a cyber-attack conducted by Russian military hackers, reports Reuters. The FBI said that it had seized control of thousands of firewalls and routers that were hijacked by Russian hackers taking over the same infrastructure that Russian spies were using to communicate with the stolen devices. Reuters further reported: An unsealed redacted affidavit described the unusual operation as a pre-emptive move to stop Russian hackers from mobilizing the compromised devices into a “botnet,” a network of hacked computers that can bombard other servers with rogue traffic. “Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said. The British politician George Galloway has threatened legal action against Twitter after the social media website flagged his account as “Russia state-affiliated media”. He had been regular fixture on the Russia Today news channel for many years. He wrote: Dear @TwitterSupport I am not “Russian State Affiliated media”. I work for NO #Russian media. I have 400,000 followers. I’m the leader of a British political party and spent nearly 30 years in the British parliament. If you do not remove this designation I will take legal action. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Gloria Oladipo will be along shortly to take over from me. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that a Ukrainian fuel storage base was destroyed by Russian missiles in the Kharkiv region, the RIA news agency quoted it as saying. The Russian forces also destroyed some Ukrainian military equipment and foreign weapons at a railway station in the same region, RIA reported, citing the ministry. Poland has arrested two citizens of Belarus on charges of spying for Minsk, which could carry a 10-year prison sentence if they are found guilty, a regional prosecutor’s office said on Wednesday. Tensions have been running high between the neighbours over a migrant crisis that the European Union and Poland say was engineered by Belarus, a charge Minsk denies. The EU also accuses Minsk of supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported. “...the suspects heard charges of espionage on behalf of the Belarus intelligence services,” a regional prosecutor’s office in Poznan, west Poland, said in a statement “They are suspected, among others, of conducting reconnaissance of military and civilian facilities of critical importance for the defense of the Republic of Poland,” the statement also said. Both were arrested for three months and are facing up to 10 years in prison. Russian artillery fire killed at least four people and wounded four others at a humanitarian aid distribution point on Wednesday as Moscow’s forces bombarded towns, cities and rail infrastructure in eastern Ukraine, local officials said. Authorities in the eastern region of Luhansk urged civilians to evacuate “while it is safe”, warning that Russian bombardments could cut off escape routes, Reuters reported. Later, Ukrainian Railways reported there were a number of casualties after three rockets hit an unspecified rail station in the east, without giving further details. Ukraine says Russian troops that invaded on Feb. 24 are regrouping and preparing for a new offensive in the Donbas area, which includes both the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko shared online photos from the town of Vuhledar, where he said Russian artillery fire had struck a humanitarian aid distribution point. The photos showed two women stretched out on the ground. Another person had a serious leg wound and a fourth was shown with a bloodied leg, being helped into a rescue vehicle. “The enemy cynically fired on civilians from Vuhledar, who had come to receive humanitarian aid. As a result of the shelling there are 4 dead and 4 wounded,” Kyrylenko wrote in a later post, updating the death toll from an earlier estimate of two killed. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has said he plans to appeal to his counterparts from G7 and Nato nations to fulfil Ukraine’s request for sufficient weapons to counter Russian forces. Speaking in a video address, Kuleba said he was meeting the other foreign ministers on Thursday, Reuters reported. “The main topic of my discussion in Brussels will be the supply of all necessary weapons to Ukraine,” he said. It’s been a big day for fresh sanctions on Russia, as countries responded to harrowing reports and images of civilian killings in Bucha earlier in the week, and sought to cripple Vladimir Putin’s economy. The US unveiled sanctions which target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia as well as sanctions on Putin’s adult daughters. The UK also announced fresh sanctions, including collaborating with the US on asset freezes against Russian banks and banning all new outward investment to Russia. In the morning, the EU also announced a wide-ranging package of sanctions, including import bans on coal and transaction bans on banks. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán gave a press conference in which he said he had offered to broker talks with Putin aimed at leading towards a ceasefire, while stopping short of agreeing to extend EU sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas shipments. Russia’s military has now shifted its focus to the east of the Ukraine, with authorities in Luhansk and Donetsk warning that civilians should leave as quickly as possible. There were reports of burning buildings in Luhansk following Russian shelling, with casualties unknown; while five were killed in Donetsk, according to the governor; and Ukrainian railways reported rocket fire on a railway station in the east of the country, which resulted in casualties, though gave no further detail on the location or number of victims. Kyiv reported 89 deaths since the start of the conflict. Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an impassioned speech to Ireland’s parliament, in which he urged the country to pile extra pressure on EU nations to introduce tougher sanctions, accusing European countries of worrying excessively about the economic consequences. Western officials said Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could move to Donbas. Thanks for tuning in today, I’m handing over to my colleague Tom Ambrose who will keep you updated on any further developments. State-owned Ukrainian Railways has said there have been a number of casualties after three rockets hit a rail station in eastern Ukraine, damaging buildings, tracks and rail stock. The statement provides no further detail on the number of victims or the location of the attack. The governor of Donetsk has said at least five people were killed by shelling today, as Russia shifts it focus to the east of Ukraine. Lithuanian Olympian Rūta Meilutytė has swum through a red blood-like pond located in front of the Russian embassy in Vilnius in protest at the conflict. The pond, which was temporarily coloured with eco-friendly dye, is intended to symbolise Russia’s responsibility for committing war crimes against Ukrainians, while the act of swimming communicates the need for continuous effort to fight through. US prosecutors are working with their European and Ukrainian counterparts to help collect evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine. US attorney general Merrick Garland said that justice department officials met with their counterparts at Europol and Eurojust this week to develop a plan to work together and are separately helping a top Ukrainian prosecutor with evidence collection as well. “Today, we are assisting international efforts to identify and hold accountable those responsible for atrocities in Ukraine,” Garland added. “And we will continue to do so.” Meanwhile, a US defence official has said that the killings in Bucha appear to be “deliberate and premeditated”. Here’s some insight from western officials obtained by the Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh: Western officials believe that Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could go to Donbas and perhaps longer given how many losses they have suffered in the war so far. The officials believe that the Kremlin wants to see some kind of victory in the eastern Donbas region in time for Russia’s traditional Victory Day parade on 9 May, an important date in the country’s military calendar. One official said that Putin will want to have an “announceable success” by then, which could create “some tension” with Russian commanders as to “what they want to do in the military terms”. This means that exhausted Russian forces are likely to be thrown into battle fairly soon in an attempt to gain ground in the east. The belief is that Russia will prioritise capturing the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, or seek to create a land bridge to Crimea or both, with Russia “reshaping its narrative” so it can redefine its idea of victory. Ukraine’s military, however, have so far been unable to reinforce their own forces in the Donbas either “partly because they’re still trying to secure those areas from which they’ve sort of repulsed Russian forces” in the north and north east - and also because they need to defend against any surprise Russian re-offensive against Kyiv, one official said. Revised estimates suggest that 29 of Russia’s battalion tactical groups, the smallest operating unit of its forces, are now “combat ineffective” from an invading force that is estimated at some 125 battalions, around 75% of Russia’s total army. There is also growing western concern about “genocidal propaganda” emerging from Moscow following a recent RIA Novesti Kremlin news agency article that called for Ukrainian society to be “cleansed of Nazi elements” and statements from former president Dmitri Medvedev who said that Ukrainian activists had been “praying to the Third Reich”. A Western official said “those sorts of comments are really creating an even more toxic information environment” and could “absolutely contribute” to Russian soldiers committing more war crimes in Ukraine. “Responsibility for this, of course lies with the perpetrators of the acts, but it also lies with the Russian leadership,” the official added. Here’s the Guardian’s full report on the new sanctions imposed by the US and its allies on Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine, as the west makes a fresh attempt to strangle Vladimir Putin’s economy and war effort. The UK is co-ordinating with the US on asset freezes against Sberbank and Credit Bank of Moscow, and has banned all new outward investment to Russia and committed to end all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible. Imports of Russian iron and steel products will be banned and a further eight oligarchs have also been added to the sanctions list. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the package was “some of our toughest sanctions yet”. She added: Our latest wave of measures will bring an end to the UK’s imports of Russian energy and sanction yet more individuals and businesses, decimating Putin’s war machine. Together with our allies, we are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin’s orders. We will not rest until Ukraine prevails. Russian largest lender Sberbank has responded to the latest wave of US sanctions, stating that it would not significantly affect the bank’s operations. A statement read: The sanctions will not have a significant impact on the bank’s operations and will not affect service to Russians as the system has already adapted to the previous restrictions. Joe Biden has spelled out in a tweet that the latest US sanctions are linked to atrocities in Bucha. The US is imposing sanctions on Putin’s daughters and Russia’s Sberbank as part of a new package of measures announced today. The measures target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia. Reuters reports: The new sanctions will put full blocking sanctions in Russia’s Sberbank, which holds one-third of Russia’s total banking assets, and Alfabank, a senior US official told reporters. Energy transactions were blocked from these sanctions, the official said. The United States was also imposing sanctions on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s adult daughters, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov’s wife and daughter, and members of Russia’s security council, the official said. Americans were banned from investing in Russia, the official said, including through venture capital or mergers. The US was “dramatically escalating” the financial shock on Russia by cutting off that country’s largest banks, the official said. Russians might be forced back into Soviet-style living standards from the 1980s, the official said. Ukraine’s human rights ombudswoman has said that more than 400 residents are missing in the town of Hostomel after a 35-day occupation by Russian forces, and she quoted witnesses as saying some of them had been killed. Ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova did not say how many people may have been killed in Hostomel, near the capital Kyiv, and cited no direct evidence for her assertion. She did not say who the witnesses were or provide any other details. Russian forces seized Hostomel, which is close to an airfield, soon after invading Ukraine on 24 February. The Guardian’s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, has a report from Viktor Orbán’s press conference: Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has said his country would have “no difficulty” in paying for Russian gas in roubles and will do so if Moscow asks. The statement undermines EU unity on Russia, after Germany and Italy, other big EU consumers of Russian gas, refused Vladimir Putin’s request to pay for gas shipments in roubles. Germany found a workaround that would allow it to pay for gas in euros, which would then be converted into roubles by Russia’s Gazprombank. Orbán was speaking at a press conference, days after a resounding victory in an election that independent monitors said was characterised by media bias, a blurring between party and state and opaque campaign finance. Orbán also said he had invited Putin for peace talks in Hungary to be attended by the leaders of Ukraine, France and Germany. The Russian president was one of the first leaders to congratulate Orbán on his victory, which was also welcomed by the far-right leaders Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini and the former US president Donald Trump. Hungary’s government did not refer to Putin in a list of leaders said to have congratulated Orbán published on an international website on Wednesday. Budapest has supported EU sanctions and condemned Russia’s war, but Hungary’s refusal to aid Ukraine with weapons, as well as virulent anti-Ukrainian rhetoric in state-controlled media, has angered allies. On Wednesday Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, announced that he was summoning Ukraine’s ambassador, a move that usually indicates a diplomatic dressing down. “It’s time for Ukrainian leaders to stop insulting Hungary and to take note of the will of the Hungarian people,” said Szijjártó, who was awarded a medal of friendship from Vladimir Putin. In recent weeks Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Orbán of siding with the Kremlin and ignoring the humanitarian catastrophe being suffered by residents of Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities. Helena Smith, the Guardian’s Athens correspondent, reports on the reaction to the Greek government decision to expel Russian diplomats: The Russian embassy has reacted with fury to the Greek government’s decision to expel 12 of its diplomats after declaring them “personae non-gratae”. Joining the growing list of EU capitals to eject Russian embassy personnel, Athens invoked the Vienna convention on diplomatic and consular relations as it announced the move earlier today. In a statement, the Russian embassy described the decision as a step that would further undermine bilateral relations between the two Orthodox Christian nations. “We have strongly protested against this unjustified and hostile step which aims to further destroy our bilateral relations,” it said, noting that the Russian ambassador to Greece, Andrey Maslov, had been summoned to Athens’ foreign ministry to be informed of the decision. “We have made clear that this action will not be without consequences.” Greek-Russian ties have been jolted as never before by the war over Ukraine with the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, not only making clear that Athens has sided wholeheartedly with Kyiv but declaring that this is no time for neutrality. “There can be no neutrality,” he told Greek MPs recently, “either one favours international law or one is against.” Greece’s centre-right administration has dispatched humanitarian and military assistance to Ukraine despite the majority of Greeks telling pollsters they believe Athens should stay out of the conflict. Ukraine is home to a large ethnic Greek community with the diaspora numbering around 150,000 people in the besieged city of Mariupol alone. Mitsotakis, like his foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, has said that protection of the community and Greece’s obligations as an EU member state will take precedence over diplomatic ties with a regime in Moscow that has so flagrantly violated international law by invading Ukraine. There’s more detail on Reuters about Viktor Orbán’s press conference, including that he asked Vladimir Putin to announce an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. Orbán, a conservative nationalist and one of the few European leaders to have good relations with Putin, said he was called by Putin, and proposed talks in Budapest around an immediate ceasefire, as peace talks would take a longer time. He said: The response was positive but the Russian president said this had conditions. I cannot negotiate to meet those conditions - it should be him and the Ukrainian president agreeing on those.” “This is a war that the Russians started, they attacked Ukraine, and it’s aggression, this is the joint stance of the European Union and Hungary shares that stance.” However, Orbán, under whom Hungary has cultivated close business ties with Putin’s Russia, has opposed any EU sanctions on Russian oil and gas or Western arms shipments through Hungarian territory to Ukraine. A spokesperson for Russia’s foreign ministry has accused Ukraine of using images of dead bodies strewn across the Ukrainian town of Bucha, which Russia says were staged, to justify more sanctions against Moscow and derail peace talks with Kyiv. Ukraine has accused the Russian military of massacring residents of Bucha, an area outside the capital Kyiv which Russian troops had occupied for several weeks before withdrawing. Western countries have called for those responsible for the murder of civilians to be punished. Reuters is carrying a little extra detail from Viktor Orbán’s press conference here which could be significant for the future. The Hungarian prime minister, fresh from winning his fourth consecutive election, told reporters Hungary must strengthen its alliance with Poland as it is a strategic alliance within the European Union. Crucially, in response to a question about a disciplinary procedure flagged by the European Commission yesterday, Orban said Hungary would wait to see the EU’s letter, but “will not give in” to pressure to support an expansion of sanctions against Russia to oil and gas shipments, as that was a “red line” for Hungary. The European Commission said yesterday is was launching a rule-of-law disciplinary procedure against Hungary. First of all, this war must end now, and President Putin end it by withdrawing its troops and forces, and under stop attacking independent sovereign countries like Ukraine and sit down in in good faith and to find a political solution. But at the same time, we have to be realistic and and realise that this may last for a long time, for many months, or even years. I also believe that, regardless of when the war ends, this has long term implications for our security. Because we have seen the brutality. We have seen the willingness by President Putin to use military force to reach his objectives. The invasion of Ukraine was a wake up call. But that happened in 2014. So we have actually, since 2014, implemented the biggest reinforcements of our collective defence. So, Nato was actually quite well prepared when Russia invaded Ukraine for the second time, and on the day of the invasion, we activated our defence plans and deployed thousands of additional troops in the eastern part of the alliance. Our graphics team have produced this updated map of the latest situation on the ground in Ukraine. One of the topics of the Nato meeting is a “New Strategic Concept”. Secretary general of Nato Jens Stoltenberg explained that it would “address the new security reality we are faced with.” He told reporters: The strategic concept will be the roadmap for Nato. How to address a more dangerous world, and how to make sure that we continue to protect and defend all Nato allies. In the strategic concept, we need to address the security consequences of Russia’s aggressive actions, the shifting global balance of power, the security consequences of a much stronger China, and the challenges Russia and China are imposing together to a rules based international order of democratic values. We will set out the strategy for how to deal with cyber, hybrid, and terrorism, and also the security consequences of climate change. A quick summary of what secretary general of Nato Jens Stoltenberg has had to say so far. He told reporters that Nato had supported Ukraine over many months, with both training and equipment, which has been making a real difference on the ground. He said: Since the invasion, Allies have stepped up their support. I also expected ministers, when they meet today and tomorrow, will discuss how we can further support Ukraine. Allies are providing both anti-tank, anti-air or air defence systems, but also different kinds of advanced weapon systems. and also both light and heavier weapon systems to Ukraine. He went on to say that he did not want to detail “exactly what kind of weapons equipment Allies are providing”, but that “the totality is significant.” Secretary general Jens Stoltenberg is making a statement before Nato’s meeting today. There is a live stream available at the top of the blog. You may need to refresh the page and then press play for it to start. Sir Mark Lyall Grant, former UK national security adviser and former UK permanent representative to the UN, said he expected “pledges of more military support” to come. PA Media quotes him telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme that there was a “balance” to be struck between military support for Ukraine which helps them in the fight against this Russian invasion and not giving Putin an excuse to escalate the conflict even further.” “I think we will see pledges of more military support of the sort of anti-tank weapons, perhaps also some anti-ship missiles, which haven’t so far reached the theatre, and also surface-to-air missiles. “When it comes to tanks and fighter aircraft ... Nato has so far been very reticent, but now that the Czech Republic appears to be deciding to send Russian-made tanks into the theatre, there may be some other Nato members who will press to do that as well.” Nato member the Netherlands has sent four F-35 warplanes to Nato ally Bulgaria to help with its air-policing tasks. but not directly to Ukraine. [see 13:31] Lyall Grant added “Certainly, the evidence of war crimes and human rights abuses that have been uncovered in recent days has raised the level of outrage in the West and definitely increased the willingness to consider further supplies of weapons. “If Ukraine is now going to go on the offensive to try and take back territory that’s being occupied by Russia in the east of the country, they are going to need slightly different type of weapons.” This is Martin Belam in London, taking over the blog for the next half-hour or so. The 193-member UN general assembly will vote on Thursday whether to suspend Russia from the Geneva-based UN human rights council. Reuters reports that diplomats have said that the US is pushing for the vote. A two-thirds majority of voting general assembly members in New York can suspend a country for committing gross and systematic violations of human rights. Russia is in its second year of a three-year term on the 47-member human rights council. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, says he has talked with Vladimir Putin at length and asked him to apply a ceasefire in Ukraine. Orbán told a news conference that earlier on Wednesday he had invited Putin for peace talks in Hungary, to be held with the Ukrainian and French presidents as well as the German chancellor. He said that Putin’s response was “positive” but that the Russian president said this would have conditions. The Netherlands has sent four F-35 warplanes to Nato ally Bulgaria to help with its air-policing tasks amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the defence ministry has said. Reuters reports: The Dutch warplanes, along with Bulgarian MiG-29 fighter jets, will help protect the airspace of the Black Sea country until 31 May, in line with Nato’s integrated plan for air and anti-missile defence. They will replace four Spanish fighter jets that have been supporting airspace surveillance of Bulgaria since the middle of February. Bulgaria, on Nato’s eastern flank, is also setting up a battlegroup of up to 1,000 troops in close cooperation with the alliance. Germany can only supply arms to Ukraine that the country’s army will know how to use, German chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. He told lawmakers in the Bundestag lower house of parliament: These are very old inventories that were used by the NVA [the army of former communist East Germany], which have the advantage that they can be used particularly well in Ukraine because they have experience with this equipment. We have to supply equipment that can be used. The governor of the eastern region of Luhansk has said that 10 high-rise buildings are on fire in the town of Sievierodonetsk after Russian shelling, with no information yet on casualties. This morning, authorities in eastern Ukraine urged civilians to evacuate, warning that Russian bombardments could cut off escape routes as forces increase attacks on the Donbas area. Sievierodonetsk is the temporary headquarters of the regional authorities as Luhansk city has been controlled by Russia-backed separatists since 2014. The US Department of Justice is set to outline new enforcement actions “to disrupt and prosecute criminal Russian activity” later today. Top justice officials, including the attorney general, Merrick Garland, and the FBI director, Christopher Wray, would discuss the action at 10am (1500 BST), the department said in a statement. New sanctions were announced earlier today by the United States and its allies against Russian banks and officials. They also planned a ban on new investment in Russia, the White House said, after officials in Washington and Kyiv accused Moscow of committing war crimes in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. The European Union has given €35bn (£29.1bn) to Vladimir Putin for energy supplies since the start of his war and €1bn to fund Ukraine’s defence, the union’s top diplomat said. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said: We have to continue arming Ukraine. We need less rounds of applause and more assistance. The EU has pledged €1bn in military aid for Ukraine, he said, which “might seem a lot” but “€1bn is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us. Since the beginning of the war we have given him €35bn. Compare that to the €1bn we have given to Ukraine in arms and weapons.” Here’s a roundup on all the key events from day 42 of the Russian invasion from reporters Samantha Lock and Martin Belam: Eighty-nine people, including four children, have been killed in Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, according to the city council. In a statement, the council said a further 398 people had been wounded and 167 residential buildings damaged by Russian strikes. The statement read: It has become safer in Kyiv, but the threat of airstrikes remains. Russia denies targeting civilians. The sight of tied bodies shot at close range in the Ukrainian streets of Bucha do not “look far short of genocide”, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said. The deaths in Bucha, outside Kyiv, have triggered a global outcry and pledges of further sanctions against Russia from the west. Johnson told reporters: I’m afraid when you look at what’s happening in Bucha, the revelations that we are seeing from what Putin has done in Ukraine, which doesn’t look far short of genocide to me, it is no wonder that people are responding in the way that they are. And I have no doubt that the international community - Britain very much in the front rank - will be moving again in lockstep to impose more sanctions and more penalties on Vladimir Putin’s regime. Norway has expelled three Russian diplomats, the Norwegian foreign ministry says. An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) team has led a convoy of buses and private cars carrying more than 500 people to Zaporizhzhia after the civilians fled the besieged Ukrainian town of Mariupol on their own. “This convoy’s arrival to Zaporizhzhia is a huge relief for hundreds of people who have suffered immensely and are now in a safer location. It’s clear, though, that thousands more civilians trapped inside Mariupol need safe passage out and aid to come in,” Pascal Hundt, the ICRC’s head of delegation in Ukraine, said in a statement. The convoy that the ICRC led left Berdiansk on Tuesday and reached Zaporizhzhia on Wednesday. The ICRC team had tried over the course of five days and four nights to reach Mariupol, and came within 20 kilometres of the city, but security conditions on the ground made it impossible to enter. The ICRC will continue facilitate the safe passage of civilians from Mariupol and other cities, provided there are security guarantees and conditions. Here’s a summary of the new sanctions announced by the European Union this morning: An import ban on coal from Russia, worth €4bn a year, intended to cut an important revenue source for Russia. A full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, among them VTB, the second largest Russian bank, intended to weaken Russia’s financial system. The four banks will be totally cut off from the markets and represent 23% of the Russian banking sector. A ban on Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing EU ports and on Russian and Belarusian road transport operators, limiting options for Russia to obtain key goods. There are exemptions for essentials, such as agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid as well as energy. Targeted export bans, worth €10bn, in areas in which Russia is vulnerable such as quantum computers, advanced semiconductors, sensitive machinery and transportation equipment. This is intended to degrade Russia’s technological base and industrial capacity. Specific new import bans, worth €5.5bn, to cut access to funds for Russia and its oligarchs, on products from wood to cement, from seafood to liquor. Several targeted measures, such as an EU-wide ban on Russian companies obtaining contracts through public procurement and an exclusion of all financial support to Russian public bodies. Sanctions against key high-profile individuals. The EU is working on possible additional sanctions, including on oil imports, taxes or specific payment channels such as an escrow account. The Kremlin has said that peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv are not progressing as rapidly or energetically as it would like. Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said work on setting up a new round of talks was under way but that there remained a long road ahead to achieve any progress. He added that Russia has all the resources needed to service its debt and there are no grounds to default. Ukraine’s state emergency services has shared images of a woman who was rescued from debris after a military strike in the town of Rubizhne, in Luhansk region this morning. In his address to the Irish parliament, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ireland has not remained neutral over the disaster Russia has inflicted on his country. He said: You did not doubt starting helping us, you began doing this right away and, although you are a neutral country, you have not remained neutral to the disaster and to the mishaps that Russia has brought to Ukraine.” He said he is grateful to every citizen of Ireland and for the country’s support of sanctions against Russia, and urged Ireland’s political leaders to use their influence to convince other EU nations to introduce even tougher sanctions to halt the Russian war machine. Zelensky went on to say that he cannot tolerate indecisiveness in sanctions against Russia. Today, when the whole world knows about the crimes against our people, we still have to convince even some of the European companies to abandon Russian markets, we still have to convince Russia of foreign politicians that we need to cut any ties of global banks of Russian banks with the global financial system. We still have to convince Europe that Russian oil cannot feed Russian military machinery with new sources of funding.” Zelensky told those gathered that Russia is using hunger as a weapon in its war against his country. They are destroying things that are sustaining livelihoods to people. They also have blocked all of our sea ports, together with the vessels that had already agricultural cargos for exports. “Ukraine is one of the leading food-supplying country in the world with exports. This is not just about the deficit and the threat of hunger. “There will be a shortage of food and the prices will go up, and this is reality for the millions of people who are hungry, and it will be more difficult for them to feed their families.” Zelensky also said that Russia needs to be held responsible for everything it has done in Ukraine. He said that in 42 days of war at least 167 children have been killed. They were targeting even churches and shelters that they knew for sure that there is nobody but women and children, and this is a fact. “The country which is doing this is not doesn’t deserve to be in the circle of the civil countries.” Speaking after the historic address, Irish premier Micheal Martin said he is certain that Ukraine will prevail in its war with Russia. We are a militarily neutral country. However, we are not politically neutral in the face of war crimes. Quite the opposite. “Our position is informed by the principles that drive our foreign policy - support for international human rights, for humanitarian law and for a rules-based international order. We are not neutral when Russia disregards all of these principles. We are with Ukraine. “Ukraine’s political, economic and humanitarian needs are now manifold and pressing. “Our efforts, as a friend and as a partner of Ukraine, are aimed at using all the levers at our disposal to bring a just end to this war; applying international pressure on Russia; pursuing accountability for violations of international law; and meeting the humanitarian needs of those caught now in the midst of this terrible and immoral war.” Rachel Hall here taking over the blog for the day. Please send over anything ideas for coverage, or things we’ve missed, to rachel.hall@theguardian.com. The governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said at least two civilians were killed and five wounded today when Russian artillery fire struck a humanitarian aid distribution point in the town of Vuhledar. The governor of Russia’s Kursk region has claimed that border guards were fired on from Ukraine yesterday. Ukraine’s military has claimed to have no knowledge of the alleged incident. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said that eleven humanitarian corridors have been agreed in total for Wednesday. Luhansk region governor Serhiy Gaidai told civilians to “evacuate while it is safe”. Russian soldiers have committed sexual violence against Ukrainian women and men, children and elderly people,” Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova has alleged. Pope Francis has condemned what he called “the massacre of Bucha” and held up a Ukrainian flag sent from the town at his weekly audience in the Vatican’s auditorium. He described the war on Ukraine as “cruelty that is increasingly horrendous”. The United States and its allies are preparing to impose new sanctions on Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine as the west makes a fresh attempt to cripple Vladimir Putin’s economy and war effort. Ukraine’s minister for foreign affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, has commented on the latest tranche of EU sanctions on Russia, saying that he appreciates the strengthening of the package. However, he called on his European neighbours to go further. saying “difficult times require difficult decisions”. Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev has said Russia will fight Western attempts to expropriate Russian property overseas with lawsuits. Hungary’s foreign ministry has summoned Ukraine’s ambassador over what it called his offensive statements on Hungary’s stance regarding the war. The European Council president, Charles Michel, has said European Union countries should think about ways to offer asylum to Russian soldiers willing to desert Ukraine battlefields. The UK’s foreign secretary Liz Truss has announced the country is to donate some NHS ambulances to Ukraine. A driver has died after ramming his car into the gate of the Russian embassy in Bucharest early on Wednesday, police in the Romanian capital said in a statement. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Rachel Hall will be with you shortly. Ukraine’s minister for foreign affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, has commented on the latest tranche of European Union sanctions on Russia, saying that he appreciates the strengthening of the package. However, he called on his European neighbours to go further. saying “difficult times require difficult decisions”. The governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said at least two civilians were killed and five wounded today when Russian artillery fire struck a humanitarian aid distribution point in the town of Vuhledar. Reuters report Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko shared graphic photos online of the aftermath of the alleged attack. Russia continues to deny targeting civilians. The European Council president, Charles Michel, has said European Union countries should think about ways to offer asylum to Russian soldiers willing to desert Ukraine battlefields. During an address to the the European parliament, Michel expressed his “outrage at crimes against humanity, against innocent civilians in Bucha and in many other cities”, then called on Russian soldiers to disobey orders. Associated Press quotes him saying: “If you want no part in killing your Ukrainian brothers and sisters, if you don’t want to be a criminal, drop your arms, stop fighting, leave the battlefield.” Endorsing an idea previously circulated by some EU lawmakers, Michel added that granting asylum to Russian deserters is “a valuable idea that should be pursued”. US authorities are allowing Ukrainian refugees to enter the country at its border with Mexico in Tijuana, with permission to remain in the country on humanitarian parole for one year. Here are some photographs taken yesterday of the refugees who are there, and the makeshift encampment they are waiting in. Two new lines on European diplomacy here, via Reuters. Firstly, Greece has announced it is joining the growing list of European countries who have expelled Russian diplomats. The Greek foreign ministry’s general secretary has informed the Russian ambassador that 12 diplomats have been declared “personae non-gratae” because the host nation says they were not acting in accordance with international rules. At the same time, the Russian deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko has insisted that Russia wants to maintain diplomatic relations with western countries despite the series of expulsions. The Interfax news agency cites him saying European countries disrupting the work of Russian diplomats were damaging their own interests. Pope Francis has condemned what he called “the massacre of Bucha” and held up a Ukrainian flag sent from the town at his weekly audience in the Vatican’s auditorium. Reuters quotes him saying: Recent news from the war in Ukraine, instead of bringing relief and hope, brought new atrocities, such as the massacre of Bucha. Cruelty that is increasingly horrendous, even against civilians, defenceless women and children. They are victims whose innocent blood cries out up to heaven and implores: ‘Stop this war! Let the weapons fall silent! Stop sowing death and destruction’. Yesterday, precisely from Bucha, they brought me this flag. It comes from the war, precisely from that martyred city, Bucha The Pope then distributed some chocolate Easter Eggs to children who had fled Ukraine, saying “These children had to flee in order to arrive in a safe land. This is the fruit of war. Let’s not forget them and let’s not forget the Ukrainian people.” Russia has repeatedly denied that any massacre took place in Bucha, offering various different explanations for the images and video that has emerged, describing them as a staged “provocation”. We reported earlier an accusation that Russian border guards had been fired upon in the Kursk region on the border with Ukraine. The area is to the north-east of Sumy. [see 7.32am] Reuters is carrying a little more detail of the alleged incident now, with a quote from Kursk’s governor, Roman Starovoit. He said “Yesterday, on 5 April, they tried to fire mortars at the position of our border guards in the Sudzhansky district. Russian border guards returned fire... There were no casualties or damage on our side.” Starovoit said regional officials were in touch with the defence ministry and urged citizens to remain calm. In separate comments to the RIA news agency, he said the mortars fired at the Sudzha border crossing did not reach Russian territory. Ukraine’s military told Reuters “We do not have such information.” Neither Russia or Ukraine’s claims have been independently verified. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has added a little to its earlier analysis of the latest situation on the ground in Ukraine. They say that heavy fighting and Russian airstrikes have continued in the encircled city of Mariupol, adding: The humanitarian situation in the city is worsening. Most of the 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender. We’ve recieved some images from the area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which at one point was occupied by Russian forces. The area is now once again under Ukrainian control, and these photographs were taken yesterday. The UK’s foreign secretary Liz Truss has just announced that the UK is to donate some NHS ambulances to Ukraine. A joint statement from the foreign office and the department of health in the UK says: The donation of around 20 NHS ambulances will help bring vital lifesaving care to Ukrainians remaining in towns and cities under attack from Russian bombardments. This donation will help replace those Ukrainian ambulances lost to Russian attacks, bolstering the existing fleet’s resilience as the barbaric war goes on. Truss is quoted as saying “The UK has been among the biggest aid donors, providing food, medicines and generators to help those affected. These world class NHS ambulances will now help bring lifesaving care directly to those injured in the conflict.” In the statement, health secretary Sajid Javid adds “The invasion has damaged key medical infrastructure and the generous donation of four ambulances by South Central Ambulance Service will ensure people in Ukraine can receive urgent care. It marks the first of many ambulances the UK government and the NHS is donating to Ukraine in the coming days.” Following on from that theme of some sections of the US political media using Kremlin propaganda lines, the actor Sean Penn has been very vocal about the situation in Ukraine and was in the country filming earlier this year, and met Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy before the Russian invasion. Last night in the US he was on MSNBC talking about the war, a clip of which has gone viral on social media Penn had two main points – firstly about his certainty that Ukraine will win out in the war, in part because of national unity. He said: To be in Ukraine, and to feel despite many political differences, you know, just like anywhere ugly positions on things, but not on this. Not on being able to determine their own dreams. They look at each other and they say we’re together. It’s a horrible moment in so many ways, but it’s an exciting moment in history, to follow the lead of the Ukrainians, because they are proof of theory. They’re going to win this thing because they’re together. And what they’re gonna win is otherwise impossible to win. And it’s a certainty. He also said that the feeling from the people he experienced in Ukraine gave him pause to reflect on the disunity among Americans, and he had a challenge for the US political class, which was: When we look back on it, what role will we have played in diminishing the death, the maiming, the rapes, the destruction of this country that’s going to have so many demands of reconstruction? This is in my lifetime … what I would say … they are offering us the greatest opportunity we’ve ever had to be the America we’ve always wanted to be. And we’ve got to figure out what we’re going to do to support them in doing that. False and conspiratorial narratives pushed by some American conservative politicians and media figures about Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine have bolstered and created synergies with the Kremlin’s legendary disinformation machine, experts on information manipulation say. Led by Tucker Carlson at Fox News, a few Republican rightwingers in Congress, and some key conservative activists, a spate of comments that have disparaged Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and echoed other Russian war disinformation have been recycled by Moscow, say experts. A feedback loop between the Kremlin and parts of the American right has been palpable since the war’s start in February. The influential figure of Carlson has pushed several false narratives to millions of Fox News viewers that have been eagerly embraced and recycled by Moscow and parts of the American right. Last month, for example, Carlson touted rightwing conspiracies that attempted to link Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, to a discredited allegation that the US financed bioweapons labs in Ukraine. On a separate front, two Republican congressional conservatives, Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene, delighted Moscow last month by condemning Zelenskiy without evidence in conspiracy-ridden terms that sparked some bipartisan criticism. Cawthorn called Zelenskiy a “thug” and his government “incredibly corrupt”, while Greene similarly charged that Zelenskiy was “corrupt”. Read more of Peter Stone’s piece here: US right wing in step with Kremlin over Ukraine disinformation, experts say Also on the topic of “humanitarian corridors”, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said that eleven have been agreed in total for Wednesday, according to a report from Reuters. She said, however, that those seeking to leave Mariupol will have to use their own vehicles. Earlier this week an agreed International Committee of the Red Cross mission to evacuate people from Mariupol was halted and turned back by Russian forces. Authorities in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk hope to evacuate civilians through five “humanitarian corridors” on Wednesday and urged residents to get out “while it is safe.” Ukraine has said Russian troops are regrouping and preparing for a new offensive in the Donbas area, which includes Luhansk. “We will take everyone out if the Russians allow us to get to the meeting places (for evacuation). Because, as you can see, they don’t always observe ceasefires,” the Luhansk region governor, Serhiy Gaidai, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “I appeal to every resident of the Luhansk region - evacuate while it is safe ... While there are buses and trains - take this opportunity. “ Reuters reports Gaidai said rail connections in the Donetsk region of Donbas had been damaged this week and took several hours to repair. “This is another alarm bell,” he said. Gaidai said separately in a video address that Russian forces had not managed to break through Ukrainian defences in his region but were destroying “everything in their path” and would “stop at nothing.” Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, although the mayor of Kyiv yesterday claimed that he had been informed that at least 5,000 civilians had been killed in the southern city of Mariupol. A few little inter-linked pieces of news have just broken. The Dutch government has said it is currently preventing 14 yachts from leaving the country due to sanctions on Russia, including 12 that were under construction for Russian owners. Reuters reports that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the statement in a letter to parliament, updating lawmakers on the enforcement of sanctions. At the same time, long-term ally of Vladimir Putin and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has been talking. Medvedev has said that Russia will fight Western attempts to expropriate Russian property overseas with lawsuits. He likened attempts to seize Russian business assets abroad to thievery, and said they would be fought in courts in the US and Europe. Those quotes broke on the wires while Peter Kyle, the UK opposition spokesperson on Northern Ireland for the Labour party, was being interviewed on Sky News. Put to him, he said “They can try what they want” but that Medvedev’s words were “an admission that sanctions against them are working. Our sanctions have been wide and far, far reaching, and the Labour party wants the sanctions to go further.” The Wall Street Journal is carrying a report that a new tranche of European Union sanctions will target the daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Laurence Norman and Ann M. Simmons write: The European Union has proposed sanctioning two daughters of President Vladimir Putin, according to diplomats familiar with the plan, a move that would add the Russian leader’s closest family members to a growing list of individuals sanctioned in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Putin doesn’t speak publicly about his family. He has two daughters with his former wife, Lyudmila Putina, according to the Kremlin. It isn’t known if Putin has other children, and it couldn’t be learned if the daughters being targeted in the EU sanctions were those he has publicly acknowledged. Richard Dannatt, who was Chief of the General Staff in the British army from 2006 to 2009, has been appearing on Sky News in the UK. On the images that have emerged from Ukraine, he said “I think the war crimes are stacking up to the point that it looks like a concerted effort to reduce the Ukrainian population. That is getting very close to the definition of genocide. It is absolutely right and proper that all these war crimes are being chronicled, evidence is been gathered.” Citing his own experience of testifying at a war crimes trial he said “If you think back to the early dark days of the Bosnian Civil War, it seemed inconceivable that Milosevic, Karadzic and Mladic would find their way into court. But they did. This is looking to me increasingly like genocide that is plotted from the top and the top therefore must bear responsibility.” On the Donetsk region he said “this is a difficult one” and a “huge dilemma” for Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In pushing for a peace deal, Dannatt asked “Is he going to insist that every square kilometre of Ukrainian soil remains Ukrainian soil? Or is he going to have to accept reality on the ground?” He felt Odesa was more straightforward, and that Ukraine must retain their major port. He suggested in the longer term that a third peacekeeping force might be required in Ukraine – although not a Nato-badged one as that would be unacceptable to the Russians. Russia’s state-owned domestic news agency RIA Novosti is reporting claims that Russian border guards have been fired on in the Kursk region bordering Ukraine. The region is to the north-east of Ukraine’s Sumy region. The Guardian has not independently verified the claims. The UK’s health secretary Sajid Javid has been appearing on Sky News in the UK. Asked about the images coming out of Ukraine he said: I think it strengthens the resolve of all of us. What we’re seeing unfolding now in Ukraine is absolutely appalling. These atrocities we now sadly seen almost daily on our TV screens, and the image you just talked of [a child with her mothers’s contact details written on her back], when I first saw that image, I think yesterday, it could have been my daughter. It could be anyone’s daughter, their son. Just to think that’s what parents are having to do in Ukraine right now because of the choice that Putin has made. And we should never forget this as a choice. This was not a a war for any other reason, it is something that Vladimir Putin has just chosen to do. And we will continue to help Ukraine in every way that we can, whether that’s military support, or sanctions on Russia, and humanitarian support. Javid did not go as far as to suggest that the UK would be pursuing regime change in Russia. He said it “is ultimately up to the Russian people about the leadership of their country.” Hungary’s foreign ministry has summoned Ukraine’s ambassador over what it called his offensive statements on Hungary’s stance regarding the war, foreign minister Peter Szijjarto has said. Reuters quotes a statement saying “It is time for Ukrainian leaders to stop their insults directed at Hungary and acknowledge the will of the Hungarian people.” At the weekend Viktor Orbán won his fourth consecutive election in Hungary, and then included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the list of enemies he said he had “over-powered”. Orbán dismissed Zelenskiy as “an actor who uses and works with the knowledge he has acquired”, and said he would not comply with any demands that would lead to “our sons dying in someone else’s war” and the “ruination” of Hungary’s economy. Zelenskiy has not called for western forces to enter the ground war. However, he responded to Orbán’s words by suggesting that the Hungarian leader would have to choose between Moscow and the “other world”, and that the Hungarian leader feared Russian influence. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog in London now from Samantha Lock. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today can be seen in the gallery below. Burned buildings marked with bullets holes and shrapnel fragments show the evidence of a brutal battle that occurred in Borodyanka, a town near Kyiv. A man walks past a disarmed missile in the street while abandoned weapons lie discarded just outside town. A driver has died after ramming his car into the gate of the Russian embassy in Bucharest early on Wednesday, police in the Romanian capital said in a statement. A video recorded before firefighters arrived showed the front of the car in flames as it remained wedged in the gate, Reuters is reporting. It was unclear whether the crash was an accident or deliberate. During recent weeks, several Russian embassies elsewhere in Europe have been targeted by protesters angered by the invasion of Ukraine. Police said they were investigating and did not release the identity of the driver. Romania said on Tuesday it would expel 10 Russian diplomats who are not acting in accordance with international rules, joining other European countries to have done so in recent days. Zelenskiy questioned the ability of the UN Security Council to provide security, undermining the very functions for which it was created during his Tuesday night national address. The UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn’t. For anyone. This definitely means that the United Nations is currently unable to carry out the functions for which it was created. And only one state is to blame for this - Russia, which discredits the UN and all other international institutions where it still participates. Well, not exactly participates... Tries to block everything constructive and use global architecture in order to spread lies and justify the evil it does. I’m sure the world sees it. I hope the world will draw conclusions. Otherwise there will be only one institution left in the world to guarantee the security of states. Namely - weapons. In an interview with Ukrainian media, Zelenskiy said it is necessary to ensure his nation is able to defend itself from Russia in the years ahead and spoke of the importance of concrete security guarantees. Even if we sign the most powerful agreement, we understand that in two years Russia may return. And if you and I accept this, then we act accordingly,” he said. Referring to concrete security guarantees, Zelenskiy said everything would depend on the guarantor countries to ensure implementation. All this is being discussed at the level of advisers and leaders with France, the United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Israel, and there are many friends who want to join. So far, we have not received a specific list of guarantees and a list of countries that are ready to join us 100%. We do not need to have 40 countries of the world that are ready to join and fight for Ukraine under the agreement. We need serious players who are ready for anything. We need a circle of states that are ready to provide any weapons within 24 hours. We need individual countries on which sanctions policy really depends, so that these sanctions are deeply elaborated in advance. So that in the first second when we feel the threat from the Russian Federation, these states will unite and within three days introduce everything at once, block everything.” Speaking of Nato, he added: If we are offered to join Nato tomorrow, if they don’t play with our lives again, but seriously offer, we will join. But this will not happen, unfortunately, and did not happen. That is why we will build those security guarantees that can protect us, protect people’s lives.” Twitter earlier announced it is introducing new measures against Russian government accounts to reduce the impact of official propaganda on the social network. The official accounts will no longer be “recommended” to Twitter users across all categories of the app, including in searches, the platform said in a statement. The California company, like its rival Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, had already blocked the accounts of the Russian state-run media RT and Sputnik in the European Union. Moscow responded by restricting access to Twitter in the country, and blocking Facebook and Instagram. We will not amplify or recommend government accounts belonging to states that limit access to free information and are engaged in armed interstate conflict - whether Twitter is blocked in that country or not,” Twitter said in a statement. When a government blocks or limits access to online services within their state, undercutting the public’s voice and ability to freely access information, but continues to use online services for their own communications, a severe information imbalance is created.” Britain is to send surplus NHS ambulances to Ukraine to replace vehicles destroyed in Russian attacks, the government has said. The foreign office said NHS trusts are expected to donate around 20 ambulances, with the first vehicles due to arrive in the country this week, according to a report from PA Media. They include four ambulances being provided by the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust. Foreign secretary Liz Truss said: “The UK has been among the biggest aid donors, providing food, medicines and generators to help those affected. “These world class NHS ambulances will now help bring lifesaving care directly to those injured in the conflict.” Earlier, prime minister Boris Johnson urged Russian citizens not to fall for Vladimir Putin’s propaganda, and to circumvent tough internet censorship rules by installing technology to discover the full extent of war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is set to make an historic address to the Irish Parliament later today. Addressing nations’ representatives, including those from Russia, he accused Vladimir Putin’s forces of creating “mass starvation” and shooting and raping civilians. Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said he expects Zelenskiy to “emphasise the brutality” of the conflict when he addresses the Dail and Seanad in a joint sitting on Wednesday, PA Media reports. “Certainly, my conversation with the Ukrainian foreign minister earlier this week was a very sobering and difficult conversation,” he said. Coveney also said that the government would keep further expulsions of Russian officials from Ireland under consideration, but added that keeping diplomatic efforts open was “important”. Zelenskiy has addressed a number of national parliaments, including the House of Commons last month, as well as the US Congress, and last week spoke virtually at the Grammy Awards. While Russian forces have been advancing further into the centre of the city of Mariupol, Ukrainian forces are still in control of some areas and have forced Russian troops out of towns in the north. The United States and its allies are preparing to impose new sanctions on Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine as the west makes a fresh attempt to cripple Vladimir Putin’s economy and war effort. Western sanctions on Russia over its nearly six-week invasion of its neighbour gained new impetus this week after bodies of civilians shot at close range were discovered in the town of Bucha, after a retreat by Russian forces. The White House said sanctions to be unveiled on Wednesday were in part a response to Bucha. The measures, coordinated between Washington, G7 economies and the European Union, will target Russian banks and officials and ban new investment in Russia. “The goal is to force them to make a choice,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. “The biggest part of our objective here is to deplete the resources that Putin has to continue his war against Ukraine.” Proposed EU sanctions, which the bloc’s 27 member states must approve, would ban buying Russian coal and prevent Russian ships from entering EU ports. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the bloc was also working on banning oil imports. Europe, which obtains about a third of its natural gas from Russia, has been wary of the economic impact a total ban on Russian energy would bring. But signalling strengthening EU resolve, Germany’s foreign minister said the coal ban was the first step toward an embargo on all Russian fossil fuel imports. Renewed pressure from the west comes after Zelenskiy gave the UN security council a harrowing account of atrocities in his country and demanded that Russian leaders be “brought to justice for war crimes”. The Wall Street Journal is also reporting that Washington is considering additional sanctions against Putin’s two daughters and Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank. The United States will provide an additional $100 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including anti-armour systems, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. Russian soldiers have committed sexual violence against Ukrainian women and men, children and elderly people,” Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova alleged in a seperate statement. But the victims are silent about it. It’s their choice. And it’s clear: fear, pain, despair, total disbelief to all,” she added. Specifically, Venediktova referenced reported atrocities committed in Bucha. “Bucha was released from the occupiers, but the consequences of their atrocities will have to be recovered for a long time: civilians were killed in the streets, cars were shot, torturers in basements,” she said. Venediktova said prosecutors are currently investigating the “horrifying fact of torturing, killing and attempting burning of bodies of six civilians in Bucha,” she added to Twitter on Tuesday. “The occupiers tried to burn the bodies of six tortured and killed civilians in Bucha,” she said, adding that prosecutors together with Kyiv Region police officers found a torture chamber in the town of Bucha in the basement of a children’s sanatorium. Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Tuesday: During the occupation of the city of Bucha, soldiers of the Russian Federation armed forces, violating international humanitarian law standards, killed civilians and set fire to their bodies in order to hide the crime. During the investigation, it was found that the bodies of the dead have traces of violent death and torture. The prosecutors of the Bucha district and Kyiv region prosecutor’s office work on the site together with police employees. Measures are being taken to determine all circumstances of the crime. The pre-trial investigation is underway.” The Buchanian District Prosecutor’s Office has initiated criminal proceedings, the office confirmed. In the basement of one of the children’s sanatoriums, law enforcement officers discovered the bodies of five men with their hands tied. Soldiers of the Russian Federation armed forces tortured unarmed civilians and then killed them. Prosecutors and police officers work at the scene of the crime. All measures are taken to determine the circumstances of every war crime and person involved in the Russian aggression in order to bring them to justice.” All over the Kyiv region, investigative and operative groups are investigating crime scenes across various districts, Venediktova said. “More than 50 national police staff and prosecutors are now involved to conduct first-ever investigations in the territory of Buchansky district alone,” she said in a statement earlier this week. Similar work is also reportedly being developed in all liberated towns in the Kyiv and Chernihiv region, with investigators collaborating with the local population to talk with witnesses, victims and gather photos and video evidence, Venediktova added, “It takes time and a professional approach to record everything correctly and not lose any chance to find and punish the guilty,” she said. Ukrainian prosecutors say they are investigating 4,684 alleged Russian war crimes after the horror of recent atrocities committed in the Ukrainian town of Bucha came to light, prompting global revulsion and a raft of crippling new sanctions against Russia. According to figures released by the prosecutors office, a total of 4,468 potential war crimes were listed as under investigation as of Tuesday with the figure growing by hundreds every day. An estimated 167 children have also died as a consequence of Russia’s invasion, the agency added. Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova described the recently liberated towns surrounding Kyiv as a “tortured region from hell” and vowed to “punish the inhumans who set it up on our land” at a press briefing held from Bucha on Tuesday. “Russia will be responsible for Bucha in The Hague,” she added in a statement published later in the day. “Prosecutors and investigators are already examining the area [Kyiv region] and documenting crimes, so that every perpetrator of these atrocities are brought to justice both in national and international courts,” she said. Ukraine’s prosecutors office has said pre-trial investigations have begun across the country, including in the regions of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Donetsk and Luhansk. “We are collecting evidence for the national courts and the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Evidence is no longer just war crimes, but crimes against humanity. And we will prove every fact to punish those who tortured, mocked and destroyed Ukrainians,” Venediktova said. The latest UK ministry of defence intelligence report is in, claiming that heavy fighting and air strikes continue in the encircled city of Mariupol. “The humanitarian situation is worsening,” the ministry added. Most of the 16,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender.” In an earlier report, the ministry said the bodies of Ukrainian civilians lay on a street in Bucha for at least ten days before the town was reclaimed from Russian forces. Citing an analysis of satellite imagery dated 21 March 2022, the ministry said at least 8 bodies were identified lying in a street in Bucha, about 30km north-west of the capital Kyiv. Bucha was occupied by the Russian armed forces until 31 March 2022. It’s Samantha Lock back with you as we continue to cover the unfolding atrocities occurring in Ukraine. Some content may be sensitive or disturbing for readers so we advise some caution in following our live blog today. Here is where the crisis currently stands: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has given the UN security council a harrowing account of atrocities in his country and demanded Russian leaders “be brought to justice for war crimes”. Zelenskiy called for an international tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials of Nazis after the second world war, speaking of Russian forces: “There is not a single crime that they would not commit there.” Atrocities in the Ukrainian town of Bucha are “only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past 41 days,” Zelenskiy said, adding that there were many more that the world had yet to learn the full truth about. “Russia wants to turn Ukraine into silent slaves,” he said. Ukrainian prosecutors say they are investigating nearly 5,000 alleged Russian war crimes after the horror of recent atrocities committed in the Ukrainian town of Bucha came to light, prompting global revulsion and a raft of crippling new sanctions against Russia. According to figures released by the prosecutors office, a total of 4,468 potential war crimes were listed as under investigation as of Tuesday with the figure growing by hundreds every day. An estimated 165 children have also died as a consequence of Russia’s invasion, the agency added. The Ukraine president also questioned the ability of the UN security council to provide security. “The UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn’t. For anyone,” he said in his nightly address. “Now Kyiv is the capital of global democracy, the capital of the struggle for freedom for all on the European continent.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he will “never forget the horrifying images of civilians killed” in Bucha. Speaking at the UN security council in New York, he said the war in Ukraine is “one of the greatest challenges ever” to the “international order”. The UN undersecretary general for political and peacebuilding affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, said allegations of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces include “gang-rape and rapes in front of children”. The Ukrainian human rights ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said between 150 and 300 bodies may be in a mass grave by a church in the town of Bucha. She did not say how the authorities had reached the estimate. Satellite imagery of one Bucha street published by Maxar Technologies from 19 and 21 March appears to show several bodies in exactly the same position as in video footage and photos taken this weekend in the same street.The UK’s ministry of defence said eight bodies had lain on the street for at least ten days before the town was reclaimed from Russian forces. Displaced residents of Bucha should not yet return to their homes because there are still mines in the area after Russian troops withdrew from the town, its mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said. Fedoruk said about 3,700 civilians had stayed in Bucha, which had a pre-war population of about 37,000, throughout the Russian occupation. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the evidence from Bucha shows “a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities” by Russian forces. “The reports are more than credible. The evidence is there for the world to see,” he told reporters. The UN human rights office spokesperson, Liz Throssell, said all the signs from Bucha pointed towards civilians having been directly targeted and killed. At the UN security council, India condemned the killing of civilians in the Bucha and called for an independent investigation. Israel also condemned Russia’s “war crimes” in Ukraine in a statement. The Kremlin said allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes by executing civilians in Bucha were a “monstrous forgery” aimed at “denigrating” the Russian army. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that remarks by US president Joe Biden calling for Russian president Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes were unacceptable and unworthy of a US leader. On a visit to Trostianets, a town close to the Russian border, the Guardian found evidence of summary executions, torture and systematic looting during the month of occupation. Yuriy Bova, the mayor of Trostianets, said it was too early to give a reliable estimate of how many civilians the Russians had killed, saying it was: “definitely more than 50, but probably not hundreds”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Nato and G7 foreign ministers meeting on Wednesday and Thursday will discuss the delivery of advanced weapons to Ukraine. Ammunition, medical supplies and “high-end” weapons systems would also be discussed, he added. The US and its allies are planning more sanctions on Russia with the objective to “deplete the resources that Putin has to continue his war against Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The new penalties will include a ban on all new investment in Russia and greater sanctions on its financial institutions and state-owned enterprises. Separately, the US Treasury Department moved to block any Russian government debt payments with US dollars from accounts at US financial institutions, making it harder for Russia to meet its financial obligations. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that the EU is also proposing new sanctions against Russia, including an import ban on coal worth €4bn (£3.3bn) per year. The package will include a full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, a ban on Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels accessing EU ports, as well as targeted export and import bans. US Army Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the United States should look at the development of more bases in eastern Europe to protect against Russian aggression, but rotate forces through them rather than make permanent deployments. Milley suggested the conflict would extend beyond Ukraine and continue for “at least” years. The United States will provide an additional $100 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including anti-armour systems, secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. The US is also providing Ukraine with life-saving protective equipment that could be deployed if Russia were to use chemical and biological weapons, a Biden administration official added. The Czech Republic also joined other nations in directly supplying Ukraine with offensive weapons, reportedly becoming the first EU country to do so since Russia invaded in February. Almost two hundred Russian diplomatic staff have been expelled from European countries this week in a direct expression of governments’ outrage at the killings of Ukrainian civilians. In what amounts to one of the biggest diplomatic breakdowns of recent years, 206 Russian diplomats and embassy staff have been told since Monday they are no longer welcome to stay by governments in Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere. British prime minister Boris Johnson urged Russian citizens not to fall for Putin’s propaganda, and to circumvent tough internet censorship rules by installing technology to discover the full extent of war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine. Twitter announced it is introducing new measures against Russian government accounts to reduce the impact of official propaganda on the social network."
Nepean River forecast to exceed 1988 levels as flash flooding in Sydney forces evacuations,2022-04-06T23:22:22Z,Calla Wahlquist and Australian Associated Press,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7yn4,"Residents in parts of Sydney’s south were ordered to evacuate their homes on Thursday with severe storms across the eastern part of New South Wales causing major flooding. In Camden, numerous rescues were carried out on Thursday afternoon as the Nepean River burst its banks, with at least five people retrieved by State Emergency Service boats, footage aired on the Nine Network showed. One group was ferried over fast-running waters after becoming stranded trying to herd their livestock to safety. The Nepean River was forecast to exceed the levels it hit in April 1988, which was higher than both the 2020 and 2021 floods, and caused widespread devastating flooding, the Bureau of Meteorology has said. The river has reached 16.8 metres at Menangle Bridge, similar to the 1988 flood levels, when it peaked at 16.75 metres. However, the BoM warned it was expected to rise to about 17 metres overnight. State Emergency Services in NSW ordered residents in low-lying parts of Woronora and Bonnet Bay, in Sydney’s south, to evacuate the area by 11.30am on Thursday, in anticipation of worsening rain and flash flooding. Residents in Chipping Norton, near Liverpool, were also ordered to evacuate some parts of the suburb by 3pm. Camden in Sydney’s south-west was also the subject of an evacuation order on Thursday afternoon, with residents in some parts of the suburb told to leave by 6pm after the SES escalated a warning it issued earlier in the day. Separately, residents in Picton, on the outskirts of Sydney’s south-west, were warned to prepare for an evacuation order to be issued, as a result of rising waters in the nearby Stonequarry Creek. Sydney has now surpassed its average annual rainfall in just over three months of 2022. The city’s Observatory Hill weather station had recorded 1,226.8mm for the year by Thursday morning, compared with the average annual rainfall figure of 1,213.4mm. Senior hydrologist Ailsa Schofield said flooding was also occurring at Wallacia on the Nepean, and North Richmond on the Hawkesbury, with flood levels expected to exceed recent river heights seen there in March. “There is also the significant risk of continued flash flooding in the Greater Sydney, Upper Hunter, Illawarra and South Coast areas from today and into the weekend,” Scofield said. “So I’m really urging residents to stay up to date with the local weather and warning information and stay safe.” The SES warned Sydney residents to stay off the roads, with fallen trees and minor flooding obstructing roads in areas of the northern beaches. A man who was swept away by flood water in the suburb of Epping was rescued by the SES on Thursday morning. The SES has responded to almost 700 requests for assistance and had carried out 25 rescues by lunchtime Thursday, the majority for people caught out by flash flooding. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning just before 5am, predicting rainfall of between 60mm and 100mm would fall over a wide stretch of the already sodden state, including Sydney, the Illawarra, the south coast, the central and southern tablelands, and parts of the Hunter. On the coast, rainfall could reach up to 140mm, the BoM said. Flood warnings were also issued for Bega, Batemans Bay, Nowra, Goulburn, Wollongong, Sydney, Katoomba and Gosford. Parts of southern Sydney recorded heavy rainfall overnight. The Cronulla South bowls club recorded 107mm in the three hours to 1.10am, Little Bay recorded 107mm in the six hours to 2.30am, Lucas Heights 57mm in two hours to 2.40pm, and Darkes Forrest 67mm in the two hours to 4.50pm. Images on social media showed motorists in Dee Why, on the northern beaches, driving through roads covered with water on Thursday morning. The state has been hit by repeated flooding in recent months, with the northern rivers area devastated by two deluges within weeks and Sydney drenched in its wettest March on record. There were 12 flood warnings in place across the state on Thursday, mostly in catchments that are already saturated from more than a month of heavy rainfall. Lismore and surrounding towns have endured two one-in-100 year floods in a month. The severe floods have also killed hundreds of thousands of fish in the Richmond River. A final flood warning was issued for the Clarence River at Grafton in the northern rivers region, which peaked on Tuesday and was falling on Thursday morning. The SES warned people in areas with flood warnings in place to prepare to leave when advised to do so. “Ensure you take pets and valuables with you,” the SES said. The bad weather has been driven by a strong upper trough over the centre of NSW, working to deepen another trough sitting off the coast. The systems were expected to weaken on Friday morning."
"Victoria’s Oz Lotto changes make it harder to win jackpot and are ‘blatant cash grab’, opposition says",2022-04-07T04:09:07Z,Benita Kolovos,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mb8,"Australians’ chances of winning the Oz Lotto jackpot are set to become slimmer after changes to the game by the Victorian government. The state government has amended the Public Lottery Licence to introduce two extra balls for Oz Lotto, which currently has participants select seven choices from 45 numbers, with two supplementary numbers drawn. That matrix will be changed so participants select from 47 numbers, while three supplementary numbers will be drawn. The changes, which come into effect on 11 May, mean the overall odds of winning any prize across all divisions will increase from one in 55 to one in 50. However, the odds of winning first division has been changed from one in 45.3 million to one in 62.8 million. Oz Lotto entrants in all states and territories will be affected, given the game is licensed in Victoria. The government said the changes mean there would be more chances of winning, not less, given the increase in likelihood of large jackpots. But the opposition’s spokesperson for gaming, Steph Ryan, described it as a “blatant cash grab” as larger jackpots provide more taxation revenue for Victoria. “By adding extra numbers to the lottery, the government is ensuring that it’s harder to win, which means it’s going to jackpot more, and bigger jackpots lead to bigger ticket sales,” she told reporters outside parliament on Thursday. “This is just another desperate grab for cash from the Andrews government to try and plug its failure to manage its own budget.” “It’s hard to imagine a more stingy move than making Oz Lotto so much harder to win.” According to the 2021/22 budget update, released in December, the state collected $599m from public lottery taxes in the financial year, about $15m more than initially forecast. This revenue is expected to increase to $624m in 2022/23, $640m in 2023/24 and $658m in 2024/25. The majority of gambling taxation revenue is allocated to funding for community organisations, mental health services, programs to tackle problem gambling, including funding for the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, as well as drug education, treatment and rehabilitation. The government said the changes were not expected to increase gambling-related harm, but the Alliance for Gambling Reform’s Tim Costello disagrees. “The decision to increase the numbers in play is nothing more than a cynical attempt to increase profits from gambling tax revenue,” he said. “Since the onset of the pandemic we’ve seen lotto participation numbers skyrocket yet instead of taking a harm reduction approach we’re seeing the Victorian government do exactly the opposite.” He said exposure to products like lotto and Keno “normalises gambling and increases the harm felt by many of the most vulnerable in the community”. “Instead of expanding the lotto numbers we want to see harm reduction measures implemented and for a ban on all gambling advertising,” Costello said. Victoria’s sports minister, Martin Pakula, said he has played lotteries for decades and the division one changes don’t bother him. “I think for most of us the difference between a one in 40 million and a one in 60 million chance is pretty academic to be honest,” he said. “I’ve played TattsLotto for 30 years and I’ve never won first division and probably never will.”"
‘She is so scared’: man who fled Mariupol fears granddaughter might be taken to Russia,2022-04-07T04:00:03Z,Bethan McKernan in Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7kjc,"After two weeks of no news, Alexsandr Obedinsky cried with happiness when he received a video call from his granddaughter, Kira. The last time he knew her whereabouts was just after her father was killed, shot on the balcony of the family’s Mariupol apartment by a Russian sniper. In the aftermath, contact with the 12-year-old girl was lost. Obedinsky had already managed to flee the besieged city for the relative safety of western Ukraine, but his son and Kira’s father, Evgeny, had refused to consider the dangerous journey. His death left Kira an orphan as her mother died two weeks after she was born. After Evgeny was killed, his partner, Anya, tried to take Kira and her own children on foot out of the city. What happened next is unclear. Obedinsky’s joy at realising Kira was alive quickly turned to fear when he realised where she was. “She was in a hospital bed, she had shrapnel wounds around her ear and face and her legs, but she seemed OK. I was so relieved. But she told me she’s in Donetsk, and it seems like she’s on her own. She told me they’re taking her to a Russian city.” The southern port city of Mariupol has been a major focus of Russia’s now six-week-old invasion of Ukraine: capturing it would link other parts of the Donbas region – such as Donetsk, which has been de-facto Russian-controlled since 2014 – with the Russian mainland. As a result, Mariupol has faced some of the worst suffering in the conflict to date. Approximately 150,000 or so of the city’s prewar population of 400,000 are still trapped by the Russian ground forces encircling the area, with diminishing supplies of water, food, medicine and fuel. All the while, besieged residents have faced airstrikes and shelling, which have killed an estimated 5,000 people. This is the situation that Anya, Evgeny’s partner, decided she and the children had to escape after his death on 17 March. From what Kira told her grandfather, it seems the family and a group of neighbours walked for around two days before coming across a minefield, which killed a little boy and injured Kira. The girl was picked up by Russian soldiers and taken to a hospital in Donetsk, where doctors said they’d take care of her, allow her access to her phone to call Obedinsky and eventually send her to a new home in Russia. “She is so scared. She doesn’t know where or why she is going,” the 67-year-old said. “I can’t say for sure what she understands about what’s going on and the war … She’s seen people killed in front of her, explosions and shelling. She just wants to come back to her family and come back home.” The Guardian has previously reported that Russia is sending Ukrainian citizens from Mariupol to “filtration camps” in Russian-controlled areas before forcibly relocating them to Russia, which is considered a war crime under international humanitarian law. A satellite image captured by US-based Maxar Technologies last week showed tented camps set up in the Russian-controlled village of Bezimenne, near Novoazovsk, and representatives of the two self-proclaimed republics in Donbas said they have set up a “tent city” for those fleeing Mariupol, which can host up to 450 people. The scale of Russia’s reported forced deportations remains unclear. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of transferring 40,000 people to its territory, a claim the Russian authorities deny. Russia media outlets have reported that hundreds of Ukrainian refugees have been sent by train to the northern regions of Yaroslavl and Ryazan. Obedinsky is desperately afraid that Kira is about to become one of that number. “I’m waiting for Kira to be able to call back again and she can tell me what’s going on,” he said. “I didn’t hear from my son for days before he was killed and, even up until the last second, I was waiting for good news. I just pray God will protect her and we can bring her home.”"
Ukraine says Russia will see new sanctions as ‘permission to attack’ amid warnings of fresh offensive,2022-04-07T03:58:22Z,"Luke Harding in Lviv, Dan Sabbagh in London",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mdy,"Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said new sanctions by the west against Russia do not go far enough and will be seen by invading forces as a “permission to attack”, as fears of an assault on the east of the country intensify. It comes after the US, UK and EU unveiled a raft of new sanctions targeting Russian banks and the country’s elites. The US measures include a ban on investing in Russia as well as sanctions on president Vladimir Putin’s adult daughters. The EU sanctions include a ban on coal imports and restrictions on banks. “This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. “If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons … it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to attack,” he said, calling for the west to reject Russian oil and completely block the country’s banks from the international finance system. Zelenskiy also said, without providing evidence, that Russian troops were now trying to cover up atrocities in Ukraine. Grisly images of dead civilians in the streets of Bucha this week sparked international condemnation and calls for Russian forces to be tried for war crimes. The UN general assembly will vote on Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the UN premier human rights body in the wake of the discoveries. Russia has denied responsibility and suggested the images were fake or the deaths occurred after its troops pulled out. However, satellite images show that bodies were lying on streets in Bucha for days before Russian troops left the town. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,” US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said this week. In other developments: The Pentagon said a “small number” of Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the United States to operate the deadly Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv. The troops were already in the US before Russia invaded. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby offered some optimism about the Ukraine resistance. “Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine,” he said. Nato foreign ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday for two days of talks on providing support to bring an end to the war. US sanctions against two of Russia’s largest banks are “a direct blow to the Russian population [and] ordinary citizens”, Tass news agency cited Russia’s US ambassador as saying on Wednesday. Anatoly Antonov made his remarks after Washington hit Sberbank and Alfabank. Ahead of an expected Russian military assault in the coming days, Ukraine has urged civilians to leave the east of the country “while the opportunity still exists”. The deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the authorities would “not be able to help” residents who stayed behind once large-scale fighting erupted. She said the governors of the Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions were calling on people to move immediately to safer areas. “It has to be done now, because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it,” she posted on Telegram. The deputy prime minister emphasised: “It is necessary to evacuate as long as this possibility exists. For now, it still exists.” The Kremlin has said it intends to seize the entire Donetsk region, amid reports that Putin is keen to declare victory in Ukraine in time for 9 May, the annual commemoration of the Soviet defeat of Hitler in the second world war. One western official said Putin would want to have an “announceable success” by then, which could create “some tension” with Russian commanders as exhausted forces were likely to be thrown into battle fairly soon in an attempt to gain ground in the east. The new focus on the east follows the humiliating failure of Putin’s original apparent plan to seize the capital, Kyiv, overthrow the Zelenskiy government and subjugate most of Ukraine in a matter of days or weeks. Instead, Russian troops who advanced on Kyiv were forced to withdraw to Belarus after shattering losses. The Kremlin has also pulled its forces out of the Sumy region after its advance there became bogged down. According to revised estimates, 29 of Russia’s battalion tactical groups – the smallest operating unit of its forces – are now “combat non-effective”, from an invading force estimated to be at about 125 battalions, which comprises around 75% of Russia’s total army. Nato and western analysts believe Russia is now determined to consolidate its gains in the south and south-east, with the Kremlin “reshaping its narrative” so that it can redefine its idea of victory. It already controls a land corridor stretching from Mariupol along the sea of Azov to the southern Kherson province and to Crimea. Its next targets appear to be the strategic towns of Sloviansk, which Russian forces and separatists held in 2014, Kramatorsk and Sievierodonetsk. Any assault is likely to run into major resistance from the Ukrainian army. Ukraine’s military, however, had not so far been able to reinforce their own forces in the Donbas, said one western official, because they were still attempting to secure areas retaken from Russian troops, and needed to defend Kyiv against any surprise attempt to retake the capital."
AFL commentators strike right note for first time in a long time ,2022-04-07T03:17:07Z,Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mv8,"Australia has been blessed with some world class sports broadcasters. Whether it’s Bruce McAvaney at the Olympics, Bill Collins calling the final furlong of a Cox Plate or Richie Benaud describing a Shane Warne leg break, they’ve been masters of their craft, and they’ve enriched our experience as fans. In recent years however, the quality of AFL commentary, particularly on Channel Seven, has plummeted. Dennis Cometti hung up the binoculars, and Bruce followed suit a couple of years later. We were left with witless, mind numbing prattle. They were shouting at us, not calling the game. They were hyperventilating when nothing was really happening, and half asleep when someone pulled down the mark of the year. As footy was becoming more congested, they were striving for superlatives, and straying into vaudeville. For a multitude of reasons, ratings were low. Given the quality of repartee, it was no surprise people were tuning out in droves. The sport had never taken itself more seriously. But footy on Seven had become a caricature of itself. Twitter is hardly a reliable barometer of public opinion, particularly when it comes to politics. Nor is it renowned for its joie de vie. But if there was one thing that could unite footy fans on social media, it was the dire state of Channel Seven’s commentary. For a while, it seemed the only solution lay in the mute button, or in pooling our life savings and paying Anthony Hudson $10m a year to call every game on the fixture. But Channel Seven did something surprising. They listened. They changed. They watered down the red cordial. And they fostered and promoted new talent. The AFLW was crucial in this regard. New and modulated voices – both men and women – were suddenly showcased to a broader audience. The penny seemed to have dropped. Viewers didn’t want a stand-up routine. They didn’t want a commentary box jammed with former legends. With little fanfare, they elevated proper broadcasters to the main commentary spots. Callers like Jason Bennett – authoritative, accurate, and economical – were suddenly calling men’s preliminary finals. Though not a play-by-play caller, Daisy Pearce provided more insights into the modern game than half a dozen hall-of-famers. This season, Alistair Nicholson crossed over from the ABC. Again, it was done with minimal fuss. Instead of “Did you see that!”, “Spot on BT”, and “Love the way he goes about it”, he called the play, he got the players’ names right, and he let the game breathe. It was no-nonsense, it was refreshing and it enhanced the viewing experience considerably. On Sunday, Matt Hill called the St Kilda-Richmond game. I’m hopelessly biased here, but I reckon he’s the best race-caller in the world. He has wonderful timing and cadences. He does his homework. He respects his audience. In a thousand metre sprint down the Flemington straight, with half the field splitting to the grandstand side, he can memorise the silks, names and jockeys of 22 horses, and still not miss a beat. Personally, having him bob up in the footy commentary box was like seeing Daniel Day Lewis treading the boards at the Titanic Theatre Restaurant. It wasn’t long ago that he was calling amateur footy on community radio. But he slotted in seamlessly. The influx of new talent has raised the standard across the board. Even some serial offenders have lifted their game. James Brayshaw’s call of Lance Franklin’s 1,000th goal was exactly what the moment called for. He let the scene speak for itself. He didn’t try and upstage it. In years gone by, you suspect he and Brian Taylor would have been running on the field themselves. On this night, less was more. This shift isn’t confined to football. For years, and particularly during home Ashes series, cricket commentary in this country was a ghastly state of affairs. But mercifully, things changed. There was a new host broadcaster. There were more women. There were fewer TV sets thrown off balconies. Finally, we could read a book, lie in a hammock or tend to a sausage while the cricket hummed in the background. Commentating a football game is a tough gig. Getting the right balance between entertainment and informative commentary, in a sport that doesn’t necessarily translate well to TV, is especially hard. In the hierarchy of footy’s grievances, Channel Seven’s commentary has tended to rank marginally ahead of Ticketek and the MCG ground announcer. On the off-chance Channel Seven bosses read the Guardian, they’re probably echoing Basil Fawlty right now – “Satisfied customer, we should have him stuffed.” But they deserve a shout out. They’ve finally struck the right tone. For the first time in a long time, they’re treating the sport and their viewers with respect."
"Paddy Moriarty and his dog allegedly killed amid feud with neighbours, Northern Territory coroner finds",2022-04-07T02:59:58Z,Caroline Graham and Kylie Stevenson,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mgy,"A coronial inquest has found that Paddy Moriarty, who went missing from the tiny Northern Territory town of Larrimah in 2017, is dead and a feud with his nearest neighbours is likely to be the key to solving the case. Coroner Greg Cavanagh said the evidence showed that Paddy and his dog, Kellie, had both died some time on the evening of 16 December 2017, when they were last seen leaving the town pub and driving the short distance home on a quad bike. Cavanagh’s findings detailed a history of turmoil between Moriarty and the residents living across the road from him in the tiny town with a population of 12. The findings included allegations the missing man had repeatedly destroyed plants and possessions on the opposite property. Fran Hodgetts, who ran a Devonshire teahouse in the town, and her gardener and caretaker, Owen Laurie, lived directly opposite Moriarty. “In my opinion, Paddy and his dog were killed in the context of and likely due to the ongoing feud he had with his nearest neighbour,” Cavanagh said. “He likely died on the evening of 16 December 2017. He had ridden home from the hotel, put the mostly-eaten chicken in the microwave, put his wallet on the table, his hat in the usual place, the dog food in the dog bowl and got his own meal out of the freezer. “He then went outside with the dog. There is no evidence as to where he went, however, in my view it’s likely that the new plants at Fran’s place were of some attraction to him.” Thursday’s coronial inquest finding comes after eight secret police recordings, taped on the property of Moriarty’s nearest neighbours, were played before the court. In the recordings, which also include singing, a man’s voice can be heard saying: “Fucking killed Paddy, hit him on the head. Smacked him on the fucking nostrils with my claw hammer,” and, “I killerated old Paddy … I struck him on the fucking head and killerated the bastard … basherated him”. The recordings were obtained by police in a six-month period after Moriarty went missing. Laurie on Wednesday told the court the voice was not his and that he did not know anything about Moriarty’s disappearance. He opted to remain silent on the basis that anything he said could incriminate him. The Coroner’s Act does not permit a finding that might suggest an individual may be guilty of an offence and the matter has now been referred to the commissioner of police and the Director of Public Prosecutions for further action or investigation. The officer in charge of the investigation, Det Sgt Matt Allen, said Moriarty’s disappearance was a “once in a generation case”. “Murder investigations are challenging, particularly without a body,” he said. “The case doesn’t get closed until it is solved. We need to find Paddy.” In February 2021, NT police offered a $250,000 reward for information that would help solve Moriarty’s suspicious disappearance. The reward is still current. Two further allegations emerged and were heard at the inquest on Wednesday. Labourer Wayne Ledwidge told the court he had overheard a conversation between his friend Brian Roberts, now deceased, and Hodgetts, in which Hodgetts offered Roberts $10,000 to “get rid of” Paddy. Hodgetts, who also gave evidence via video link from Melbourne, denied such a conversation had taken place and said she did not know Roberts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Truck driver Michael Pangquee also gave evidence that he had heard another former Larrimah resident, Richard Simpson, implicate another man in the murder, but police said there was no evidence to support this. The findings outline the life of Moriarty, who moved to Australia from Ireland aged 18, and settled in Larrimah after working on remote stations as a ringer, grader driver and station hand and competing on the rodeo circuit. The 30-page document also charts the relationships, tensions and hardships in Larrimah, which had only 12 permanent residents when Moriarty disappeared. The case will be the final inquest for Cavanagh. “Close the door,” he told the court, after delivering the findings. “Shut the gate. Draw the blinds. Drop the curtain. Turn off the lights. It’s all over for me … my final inquest. Cheerio.”"
"Queensland child protection system failing Indigenous domestic violence victims, report finds",2022-04-07T02:45:58Z,Jordyn Beazley,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7teq,"Queensland’s child protection system is failing First Nations children exposed to domestic and family violence, with some victims going through their entire childhood without receiving therapy or specialist support despite being in and out of home care, a report has found. Often it is only when a man is later recognised as a perpetrator of violence himself that he receives help for his experiences as a child, according to the New Ways for Our Families report, released on Thursday. The failures in the system are increasing young people’s interaction with the youth justice system and fuelling the intergenerational trauma that can perpetuate domestic and family violence, the report found. The research was led by the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Protection Peak, with support from the Australia’s National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety and Australian Catholic University’s Institute of Child Protection Studies. Researchers interviewed people working in eight community-controlled child and family services in Queensland. The research is the first step in a series of activities working to improve support for First Nations children experiencing violence. This includes giving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children a role to play in designing programs that meet their needs. The report recommends Aboriginal-controlled organisations be better resourced to drive culturally appropriate support. “To break the cycle of intergenerational trauma, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people need opportunities to heal from experiencing domestic and family violence including being heard,” said Garth Morgan, the CEO of the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Protection Peak. “Support is also needed for their families and communities to address domestic and family violence in holistic and culturally strong ways.” When a child is a victim of domestic and family violence, the main response is to remove the child from their family and community and place them in out of home care. The report said this is despite the fear of child removal being one of the greatest deterrents for First Nations women to report violence or seek assistance. Prof Daryl Higgins, the director of the ACU’s Institute of Child Protection Studies, said the problems expressed in the report are not unique to Queensland and there is an overrepresentation of First Nations children in child protection systems nationwide. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report found there are few culturally appropriate family violence services available to First Nations people. Of those that do exist, they mainly focus on adults and not on the specific needs of children and young people. In the communities the research focused on, it found that less than a quarter of domestic and family violence referrals supported First Nations families and less than 5% on average were for children or young people who were victims of domestic and family violence. In some of the areas studied, this was only 1%. The report said there are First Nations communities in Queensland that are driving successful programs to address domestic and family violence. But the report said underfunding is hampering these efforts. The 2019 National Children’s Commissioner’s Children’s Rights Report highlighted a lack of resourcing and ability to track government expenditure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people. The New Ways for Our Families report stated little has changed since then to address the funding disparity. The minister for women’s safety, Anne Ruston, said the Morrison government was developing two five-year Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander action plans, in addition to the national plan to end violence against women and children. “Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children have the greatest knowledge about the issues that affect them and we must work in genuine partnership to design programs that meet their needs,” Ruston told Australia’s National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety, which was a co-author on the report. “The [New Ways for Our Families] report will be a useful tool to help inform the Action Plan as we build on the $45m the Morrison government provided in the 2022-23 Budget for Indigenous-specific measures.”"
What would following Australia’s ‘leadership’ on the climate crisis actually look like?,2022-04-07T01:47:18Z,Graham Readfearn,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7tdj,"If the rest of the world followed Australia’s “leadership” on cutting greenhouse gas emissions and reaching net zero, what would that mean? This was the question we were left to ponder after the assistant energy minister, Tim Wilson, defended the Morrison government’s record this week after the latest UN climate assessment was released. “We need global emissions to come down, which means we need other countries to follow our leadership in making sure they take decisions and back them in,” Wilson told the ABC, while criticising the UK and China for “backsliding” and a lack of commitment on targets. Despite having multiple opportunities in recent years to increase its 2030 emissions reduction target – including before the most recent UN climate talks in Glasgow – Australia has stuck like glue to its unambitious Abbott-era goal, agreed almost seven years ago. If the rest of the world followed that level of “leadership” on emissions cuts, then analysts have said global heating would reach 3C or above. Does that “leadership” include agreeing at those global climate talks that countries should “revisit and strengthen their 2030 climate targets” within a year, only to then issue a “yeah, nah” in the days that followed? That was not so much a backslide as self-induced whiplash. Does this “leadership” include celebrating booming coal and gas exports, as the resources minister Keith Pitt did last month? Does it include a “gas-fired recovery”? Does it include being the world’s second-largest exporter of thermal coal and the joint biggest exporter of LNG? Does it include approving four coalmines in a month, just weeks before the Glasgow talks? Is asking for coal plants to run for their entire lifetime, as the prime minister has done, something that all other countries should be doing? Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wilson also claimed the Morrison government was the first “in Australian history to announce a comprehensive economy-wide plan towards carbon neutrality by 2050.” This “economy-wide plan” equates to choosing several technologies for funding and development and then setting some “stretch goals”. And here is your almost weekly reminder that the government’s modelling of its plan showed that by 2050, Australia would be short of zero by 226m tonnes of CO2-equivalent. The “plan” said that under these technology goals, Australia would still need to buy 94m tonnes of overseas offsets and generate 38m tonnes from a controversial negative emissions technology which experts have described as farcical and unproven. Gas to go? Australia’s powerful gas lobby said the IPCC’s report “confirms the important role natural gas and its decarbonisation tools play” to cut emissions. The Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association chief executive, Andrew McConville, said: “Gas will continue to be a part of the future cleaner energy mix as a cleaner alternative that complements so many of the pathways to net zero by 2050.” What the IPCC report actually said is far more nuanced and conditional, making clear that getting to net zero under its various scenarios would see the use of gas fall. Where it was used – either for electricity, direct power or for hydrogen production – any continued use of gas would be heavily reliant on carbon capture and storage (CCS). Without CCS, the report says keeping global heating close to 1.5C would see gas use drop by 70% between 2019 and 2050. But despite decades of promises, CCS remains expensive and marginal. The industry’s own data, examined in this column last year, suggest globally it can currently capture only about 0.3% of the 36.4bn tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuel use. The IPCC report also says investments in fossil fuel infrastructure will see energy systems “locked-in” to higher emissions, “making it harder to limit warming to 2C or 1.5C.” Budget for higher electricity prices? Last week’s official budget papers claimed the government “has achieved its goal of wholesale electricity prices under $70/MWh” in the past two financial years. “That was temporarily true,” says Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems expert at the University of Melbourne. “But it looks odd at the moment given what’s happening with wholesale prices,” he said, with prices rising rapidly. McConnell, who tracks energy prices closely, says wholesale electricity costs in the National Electricity Market did drop below the $70/MWh mark for the financial year 2020 to 2021. But if you take the 2021 calendar year, then they didn’t average this low. In the first quarter of this year, the price across the National Energy Market was $108/MWh and, with the exception of South Australia, wholesale prices are double what they were a year ago. They are still rising, he says, and will probably be passed on to consumers by retailers soon. McConnell said the reason behind these price increases was partly down to the rising cost of coal and gas as countries exclude sources from Russia (which, as I mentioned earlier, was an issue celebrated last month by resources minister Keith Pitt). Bjorn again Commentator and political scientist Bjorn Lomborg appeared annoyed that UN secretary general, António Guterres, and other world leaders are still making the climate crisis a priority as Russian forces kill civilians in Ukraine. In a column in The Australian, which also ran in the Wall St Journal, Lomborg wrote “the global elite has an unhealthy obsession with climate change.” Under a threat of nuclear war, Lomborg pointed to the supposed costs of getting to net zero, referencing a report from consultants McKinsey. The report, Lomborg claimed, showed “the policies will cost $US9.2tn every year until net zero is supposed to be achieved in 2050” and that “according to the McKinsey study” this meant achieving net zero would “cost every American family $US19,300 a year.” Yet Lomborg did not explain that the same McKinsey report said this spending “should not be seen as merely costs” and that “many of the investments have positive return profiles”. A spokesperson for McKinsey &amp; Company told Temperature Check the $9.2tn figure related to total spend and not an increase, and included $2.7tn that would continue to be spent “on high-emissions assets”. “Furthermore, our projection shows that if the current policies put in place across countries, as well as their expected population and income growth, were accounted for, the increase could be only about $1tn annually,” the spokesperson said. That spending, McKinsey said, “would prevent the further buildup of physical risks and the additional costs arising from a more disorderly transition, which could be sizeable in both economic and humanitarian terms.” And what of Lomborg’s claim that McKinsey had found achieving net zero would cost every American family US$19,300 each year? This was “a mischaracterisation of our work”, a spokesperson said, adding “such a claim overstates and oversimplifies the manner in which costs of the transition would be shouldered.” Private enterprise would carry out a “significant portion” of the spending, McKinsey said, and some of this “eventually flows to households in the form of supplier payments, salaries and consumer surplus”. “This is not a public sector expense that would be financed solely by taxpayer’s money,” McKinsey said. Lomborg told Temperature Check his description of the $9.2tn figure as a cost was “similar to how Bloomberg describes the report with its headline “McKinsey Pegs the Price Tag of a Livable Climate at $9.2 Trillion a Year”. He said: “We get both energy, jobs, and zero CO₂ emissions for this cost, but this is what is normally understood to come along with the cost of a policy.” Lomborg also argued McKinsey’s reference to the additional cost being as low as $1tn a year was across two scenarios that were not comparable because they assumed different energy outputs. McKinsey rejected this claim, saying “the relevant metric is not total energy output, but rather the ability to meet the world’s energy needs.” McKinsey added it was “incomplete to consider those [$9.2tn] costs in a vacuum without mention of the anticipated benefits of the policies”. “For this reason, we urge consideration of the benefits alongside the costs so a more informed decision on the value of the investment can be made.” Lomborg claimed it was “absolutely relevant” to “highlight the cost per family” because he claimed the spending “can only be shouldered by Americans”. McKinsey said framing the spending as a cost to individual families “misstates the distribution of costs and unfairly leaves out the value of the benefits” to families. A statement added: “While you could potentially argue that a certain figure would be spent in the United States per person or per family on average, it is simply untrue that every American family would be shouldering that bill or that they would be shouldering it at the same rate and in the same fashion.”"
Blast food: chip factory calls bomb squad after muddy spud turns out to be grenade,2022-04-07T01:31:05Z,Eva Corlett in Wellington,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7yy7,"New Zealand’s bomb squad has been called into a chip factory after a suspicious-looking potato trundling down the production line turned out to be a grenade. Grenades frequently pop up in potato fields in Europe, but are a highly unusual find in New Zealand. The weapon had been sent to Auckland’s East Tamaki Mr Chips factory on Tuesday, after being dug up from a potato farm in Matamata, in the Waikato region. The rusty grenade could easily have been mistaken for a large dirty potato, but an eagle-eyed worker spotted it before it became an unpleasant addition to a bag of hot chips. Night shift worker Richard Teurukura told news website Stuff, he pulled the device from a “potato reception area”, where 100,000 potatoes had been delivered at 3.30am on Tuesday. Initially, he thought the object was a muddy stone but on further inspection, was surprised to discover it was a grenade. He stopped the conveyer belt and asked his colleague who had “seen a lot of war movies” to confirm it was as he suspected, and the grenade was then placed in a cordoned off area at a safe distance from staff. The defence force’s explosive ordinance disposal team arrived shortly after 4am and found it was inert. The roughly 80-year-old grenade was a British-manufactured “Mills bomb” hand grenade that was widely used in the first and second world wars, the defence force confirmed. The Mr Chips factory’s operations manager, Roland Spitaels, told Stuff it was the first weapon discovered on the chain in the factory’s 30-year history. “I think it’s quite remarkable [Teurukura] did pick it up, hats off to him for keeping his cool about the whole thing,” Spitaels said. “The guys took the right safety precautions but there was still extreme interest.” Spitaels said he has photocopied a picture of the grenade to place around the factory so other workers know what to look out for. The object itself is now in police care, undergoing investigation, but Spitaels said he would eventually like it back for the factory’s trophy room. “It made for a more interesting night than we normally have,” he said."
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 43 of Russian invasion,2022-04-07T01:05:57Z,"Samantha Lock, Rachel Hall and Martin Belam",https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7m27,"Ukraine is braced for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across Donbas. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster Ukraine’s war effort, including war planes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato headquarters, where foreign ministers of member states are meeting later on Thursday, Kuleba said three items were on his agenda for when he talked to the allies and held bilateral meetings: “Weapons, weapons and weapons”. The UN general assembly will vote later on Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the new package of western sanctions against Russia were “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia would view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. Russia’s defence ministry said it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuhuiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the south-east of the country. Russian air attacks are now focused mainly on areas of eastern Ukraine and Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the region, according to the Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych. At total of 10 humanitarian corridors will be open for civilian evacuations across Ukraine today, but Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said residents trying to leave Mariupol would again have to use their own vehicles. The mayor of Mariupol said more than 100,000 people still needed urgent evacuation from the city, and that more than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, had been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the US supplying Ukraine with weapons would “not contribute to the success of Russian-Ukrainian talks”. Poland’s deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz said the country needed financial assistance over the arrival of 2.5 million of Ukrainian refugees, many of them children. The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Athens would ask the international court of justice at The Hague to investigate war crimes in Mariupol. Ukraine and Hungary again exchanged barbed words. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it considered Hungary’s willingness to pay for Russian gas in roubles an “unfriendly act”. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, confirmed that fuel for his country’s nuclear power plants had arrived by air from Russia, and restated that Budapest did not support proposals for European energy sanctions against Russia. Defence ministers from Black Sea coastal countries held a video call to discuss the war in Ukraine, mines floating in the sea and regional security, the Turkish defence ministry said, adding that the ministers called for an immediate ceasefire. Russia’s communications watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for allegedly violating Russian law. Roskomnadzor accused YouTube of being one of the “key platforms” it claimed was spreading fake information about Russia’s conduct in the war. YouTube suspended the account of Wang Jixian, a Chinese national in Odesa who has criticised Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. He was reported to the platform for content containing “suspected violence”. The number of alleged Russian war crimes Ukraine says is under investigation has increased to 4,820, according to a recent update from the country’s prosecutor general’s office. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said Australia was imposing sanctions on 67 Russians over the invasion of Ukraine. Austria, meanwhile, is to expel four Russian diplomats."
Scott Morrison caves in to co-funding Queensland flood resilience package after fierce criticism,2022-04-07T00:01:34Z,Ben Smee,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7mvq,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the commonwealth will co-fund a $741m natural disaster resilience package for flood-prone Queensland communities – just a day after rejecting the request and claiming it was not his government’s responsibility. Morrison made the about-face during an interview with Brisbane radio station 4BC on Thursday morning. It followed fierce criticism of the Morrison government on Wednesday, including from the Insurance Council of Australia, which said the federal government could not “wash its hands” of responsibility. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, wrote to Morrison on 19 March asking to go halves in the package, designed to pay for retrofitting, house raising or the voluntary buyback of flood-damaged homes. Morrison wrote to Palaszczuk on Tuesday night rejecting the request. He said in his letter that the measures were “outside the scope” of federal disaster recovery programs and the responsibility of state and local governments. When asked about the situation on Thursday morning, Morrison said the federal government had already committed more money to flood recovery than the Queensland government and that the requests made “go well beyond” others for “floods of this nature”. He said the federal government would now pay for half the resilience package. “If Queensland wants to play politics with floods before an election, that’s up to them,” Morrison said. “I don’t want to play politics with this, I just want to make sure people get the help they need. “Yes, we will provide that support. Yes, it is beyond the scope of what is normally done.” At a press conference in the flood-hit suburb of Goodna, Queensland’s treasurer and acting premier, Cameron Dick, said it was “regrettable that it took so long for the prime minister to act”. “It took him three weeks to consider our proposal. In 36 hours, after the prime minister said no, he’s now said yes,” Dick said. “This should not be the matter of whether there’s an election or not, this should be a matter of government business.” Dick labelled as “nonsense” a claim from the prime minister that more transparency was needed to ensure payments were being made. “The Queensland Reconstruction Authority is responsible … for all resilience payments,” Dick said. “Currently, [the prime minister has] two advisers on the board ... he knows exactly what we do with the money.” Morrison told 4BC the federal government would attach “conditions” to the payment that demanded Queensland be “transparent with the payments being made … I want them to report to the public”. He claimed the Queensland government was sitting on $52m provided for previous disaster recovery, a claim Guardian Australia is seeking to verify. On Wednesday, the Insurance Council of Australia released a statement that criticised the federal government’s decision not to help fund the resilience package. In February, the ICA released a report calling for $726m to be invested jointly by the Queensland and federal governments over five years. It had welcomed the resilience funding when it was announced by the Queensland government. “As severe rain and flooding continues to impact the east coast, the failure of the federal government to match Queensland’s investment in measures to improve household and community protections against extreme weather is disappointing and short-sighted,” the ICA’s chief executive, Andrew Hall, said. “If Australia is to get serious about improving our resilience to flood, bushfire and cyclone, all levels of government must contribute. “Australians – particularly those still impacted by the ongoing rain and flooding – want governments to come together to provide better protections against worsening extreme weather, not wash their hands of responsibility.”"
"UK’s top 0.1% earners have annual income of over half a million, says IFS",2022-04-06T23:01:37Z,Richard Partington  and Phillip Inman,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7khg,"The top 0.1% of earners in the UK have annual incomes in excess of £500,000, according to a study by a leading thinktank that shows the effect of “unfair” tax rates available to business owners. More than 50,000 people in the top income bracket account for 6% of all earnings – 60 times greater than their population share, said the Institute for Fiscal Studies in a report covering the 10 years to 2019. It showed that more than half of the top 1% richest adults lived in London and the south-east, while almost 60% were aged between 45-64, and as few as a fifth were women. The report, Top Income Inequality and Tax Policy, shows that earnings from self-employment and business ownership were far more important for those at the top end compared with low and middle earners. Suggesting that this has consequences for inequality because income from company ownership is taxed at a lower rate than earnings from work, the report argues that reforms could be launched to tackle unfairness in the tax system. Alex Beer, welfare programme head at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the research as part of the IFS Deaton review of inequalities, said: “The current design of the tax system, including the way in which different forms of income are taxed at different rates, is unfair and inefficient, penalising employees and distorting investment decisions, to the detriment of social wellbeing.” According to the report, business income – from either self-employment or owning and running a company – accounts for 21% of total incomes for the top 1% of adults and 29% for the top 0.1%, compared with just 9% for the rest of the population at large. It said business owner-managers could effectively choose to take income out of their company through the form of a salary, dividends, or capital gains – allowing them to benefit from lower rates of tax. The report pointed to a preferential 10% rate of capital gains tax, called business asset disposal relief, while saying that company owner-managers were able to access tax rates of just 27% on income taken in the form of capital gains. In comparison, the average tax rate on wage earners in the top 1% is 42%. The government sets the basic rate of income tax at 20% on earnings above the tax-free personal allowance of £12,571, up to £50,270, with a rate of 40% on income above £50,271, and 45% above £150,000. Despite the lower rates open to business owners, the IFS said taxes on the highest-paid wage earners had increased since 2010. As a result, the share of overall after-tax income in the UK received by the highest earners had fallen from 14% in 2009-10 to 11% in 2018-19. Illustrating the gulf between public and private sector pay at senior levels, the Taxpayers’ Alliance said in a report earlier this week that only 2,921 people employed by local authorities in 2020-21 received more than £100,000 in total remuneration and 739 received over £150,000, 46 more than the previous year. According to the Institute for Government, just 1,560 of the 456,410 civil servants earned more than £100,000 in 2020. Across the whole civil service, the majority of staff (55%) were paid below £30,000."
"Inflo, Ed Sheeran and Adele lead Ivor Novello nominations",2022-04-06T23:01:37Z,Lanre Bakare Arts and culture correspondent,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7j6j,"Adele, Ed Sheeran and Inflo, a musician billed as “the most influential and mysterious producer on the planet”, have dominated the Ivor Novello award nominations in a year in which drill artists were also recognised by the most prestigious songwriting awards in the UK. Dean Wynton Josiah Cover, AKA Inflo, leads the award nominations, which celebrate Britain’s best songwriters and composers, with four, while Ed Sheeran – who has just won a plagiarism battle over his song Shape of You – has three nods and Adele is in the running for two awards, including songwriter of the year. Adele will compete for the songwriting award with Coldplay, Raye, Dave and Ed Sheeran, who also has two songs – Bad Habits and Shivers – nominated in the PRS for music most performed work category. Inflo has credits on three of the five albums nominated in the best album category, with work on Cleo Sol’s Mother, Sault’s Nine and Little Simz’s Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, while Nottingham duo Sleaford Mods’ LP Spare Ribs and Laura Mvula’s 80s pop-inflected Pink Noise round out the category. Mvula said she was delighted to receive the nomination for the album she worked on during lockdown after being dropped by her label, despite producing two Mercury prize-nominated albums. “Sometimes it was hard to imagine getting to the finish line, so to know that it has made some impact in such strange times is really exciting for me,” she added. The songwriter said the lineup for this year’s Novellos, which is one of the most diverse ever, was important, especially for young Britons who will see people like themselves represented. She said: “They need to know that they can do whatever they want to do, especially when it comes to creativity and the arts. I’m genuinely thrilled to feel empowered and celebrated, and to be a symbol of something that is needed and positive in this ever-changing climate.” The hip-hop genre drill was also recognised with Russ Millions and Tion Wayne’s number-one single Body nominated in the best contemporary song category, alongside FKA Twigs’ Don’t Judge Me, a collaboration with rapper Headie One and Fred Again. James Blake’s track Coming Back, featuring SZA, PinkPantheress’s Just For Me and Little Simz’s I Love You, I Hate You all secured nods. Elsewhere, Jonny Greenwood’s soundtrack for Pablo Larraín’s Diana, Princess of Wales biopic, Spencer, is up against scores for After Love, Censor, The World To Come and Edgar Wright’s time-travelling psychological thriller Last Night In Soho. Inflo’s domination of the Ivor Novello nominations continues his meteoric rise. He has already won a Novello for Little Simz’s Grey Area and worked on Michael Kiwanuka’s Mercury-prize-winning album Kiwanuka, before teaming up with Simz again on her award-winning album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert and contributing to Adele’s 30. He is a member of the press-shy Sault project, which has melded hip-hop, soul, spoken word and R&amp;B over the course of five releases, and at this year’s Brits he became the first black Briton to win producer of the year, following in the footsteps of Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel and Calvin Harris."
"UK’s freedom of information laws are being undermined, warn journalists ",2022-04-06T23:01:37Z,David Pegg,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7tpq,"More than 100 journalists, politicians and campaigners have signed an open letter warning that the UK’s freedom of information (FoI) laws are being undermined by a lack of resources and government departments obstructing lawful requests. The signatories include the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, Katharine Viner, the editor of the Observer, Paul Webster, as well as the shadow solicitor general, Andy Slaughter, the former Brexit secretary David Davis, and the former Green party leader Caroline Lucas. The letter, which was coordinated by the online news organisation openDemocracy, is addressed to the new information commissioner, John Edwards, who is responsible for enforcing FoI law, which grants members of the public the legal right to request official information from public bodies. Edwards’ organisation, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), reviews complaints against public bodies that have refused FoI requests and can order them to release material if they have failed to comply with the law. However, there is growing concern among journalists and researchers that the UK’s FoI system is increasingly being frustrated by under-resourcing and deliberate non-compliance by government departments. The Campaign for Freedom of Information recently reported that backlogs at the ICO had become so extensive that it was taking an entire year for case officers to be assigned to review complaints. Last year a judge accused the Cabinet Office of having “misled” a tribunal about the operation of an alleged blacklisting system for FoI requests from journalists, called Clearing House, and described a “profound lack of transparency” surrounding the unit. The open letter calls for the ICO to assign more resources to FoI casework, monitoring of public bodies that fail to comply with the law, and stronger enforcement protocols for government bodies that repeatedly flout the law. It also recommends the extension of FoI to cover private companies that provide public services. “As the British public is still being kept in the dark over Partygate, the importance of transparency has rarely been more obvious,” said Peter Geoghegan, the editor-in-chief of openDemocracy. “FoI is a key tool for holding public bodies to account, but currently the Information Commissioner’s Office is not ensuring that the Freedom of Information Act delivers. We welcome the new information commissioner’s listening exercise and are keen to share our views on how FoI can be better policed.” Viner said: “Journalism in the public interest often depends on freedom of information laws, which help the public understand the decisions made by the authorities. Such laws are essential to a well-functioning democracy. “When the government fails to meet its transparency commitments, it is essential that the ICO is able to step in to make sure ministers and public bodies comply with the law.” In response to the letter, Information Commissioner John Edwards said: “We acknowledge the concerns expressed in this letter. FOI plays an important part in civic engagement and holding public services to account, and we share the desire to see the law work effectively.” He continued: “We all benefit from a modern law, and I think there are suggestions in this letter that warrant further consideration.” Simon Mundell, a Cabinet Office spokesperson, said: “This government remains fully committed to its transparency agenda, routinely disclosing information beyond its obligations under the FOI Act, and releasing more proactive publications than ever before.” He added that the Clearing House had existed since 2004, and was intended to ensure “a consistent approach to dealing with FOIs across government” and that “requests for particularly sensitive information are handled appropriately”."
Liberty threatens to sue government over ‘racist’ joint enterprise law,2022-04-06T23:01:36Z,David Conn,https://www.theguardian.com/p/y7k77,"The human rights group Liberty is threatening to sue the government and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) over the bitterly contested law of joint enterprise, arguing that it is discredited and racist in the way the authorities pursue it. Under the law, people present when a person is killed can be convicted of murder despite not committing any serious violence themselves, if they are found to have “encouraged or assisted” the perpetrator. Liberty is acting for the campaign group Joint Enterprise Not Guilty By Association (Jengba), which supports approximately 1,400 people in prison who believe they have been unjustly convicted of serious crimes perpetrated by somebody else. Many joint enterprise prosecutions cast all participants in an incident as a gang, which ascribes to them a collective motive for an attack. There have long been accusations, supported by academic studies and parliamentary inquiries, that the gang label is attached disproportionately and without adequate evidence to black and minority-ethnic young men. The Guardian has reported extensively on the 2017 case in which seven black and mixed-race teenagers were convicted of murder, and four more of manslaughter, after the fatal stabbing in Moss Side, Manchester, of Abdul Hafidah, 18, by one of them. Greater Manchester police and the CPS portrayed all the young men as a gang who “controlled territory” but presented minimal evidence of criminal gang activity, and most of the defendants had no criminal records. Neither the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) nor the CPS records numbers of joint enterprise prosecutions, nor the defendants’ ethnicity or age, nor whether gang evidence was advanced in a case. Liberty argues that means the authorities are breaching their duties under the Equality Act because they are failing to “ascertain the extent of, and eliminate, any race discrimination in the use of joint enterprise laws”. In a letter sent to justice secretary Dominic Raab and director of public prosecutions Max Hill last month, Liberty called on the MoJ and the CPS to immediately begin recording and publishing such data, and “properly take into account” the duty to apply the joint enterprise law equally. Liberty threatened to issue a judicial review claim against both the MoJ and the CPS if they did not respond positively by Monday, 4 April. Both have asked for more time to respond. Lana Adamou, a lawyer at Liberty, said: “We all want our communities to be safe, and for our laws to treat us equally. But joint enterprise is overwhelmingly used against people from marginalised communities, especially young black men, and drags people unfairly into the criminal justice system. “It’s completely unacceptable that there is still no official data being recorded about how the doctrine is used and who it is used against. By failing to do so, the justice system has been recklessly sweeping thousands of young black men into the prison system.” Gloria Morrison, co-founder of Jengba, said that joint enterprise has been applied in a racist way to “over-criminalise” people, and described it as “common law, used against common people, that makes no common sense”. A CPS spokesperson said: “We have received a letter from Liberty regarding joint enterprise prosecutions and we will respond in due course.” An MoJ spokesperson said: “While charging decisions are made by independent prosecutors, we are currently considering the feasibility of collecting data on joint enterprise cases.”"
