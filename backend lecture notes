MTBF = Mean Time Between Failures
prepare in advance whatever you can (like give your autonomous car a map of the area and not just have it create its own map from scanning).
if we prepare things in advance- the things we load in advanced have to be up to date and accurate (Like the map)

python is the best : )
(not the most efficient in running time but can use to develop very fast, has a lot of libraries and interactive tools like notebooks)
use DAG in planning
we should define well each step and the transitions between the steps so we can all work simultanously 
we need to divide our flow into blocks so different ppl can work on them but also that they don't depend on each other too much so we can work at the same time

make our data (from running, to find mistake etc) accessible (just spewing it into logs might not be the best ..)

just checking i can commit- Shir!
